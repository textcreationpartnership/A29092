            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN, <hi>immediately</hi> after the Death of the Right Honourable <hi>Arthur</hi> (late) Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I did firſt make enquiry with relation thereunto, upon ſuch<note n="a" place="margin">Page 5.</note> Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I have already given your Lordſhips) there was nothing that might be expected from a <hi>Powerful</hi> and <hi>Revengeful</hi> Party, <hi>againſt which</hi> I then moved, but what I did believe they would endeavour to <hi>inflict</hi> upon me; for this I had the greater reaſon, having then been often credibly told, That <hi>SOME</hi> (whoſe Intereſt was <hi>moſt</hi> concerned to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> this Diſcovery) had ſeveral times declared, I ſhould be both <hi>Pillory'd</hi> and <hi>WHIPT.</hi> But <hi>this, or whatever elſe was within their power to impoſe,</hi> I was reſolved ſhould

               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The <hi>Prevention</hi> (as much as in me lay) of ſuch vile Practices, was <hi>not</hi> the <hi>leaſt</hi> Inducement that firſt mov'd me to this Inquiry; and whatever <hi>Oppoſition</hi> I <hi>then</hi> met with, either under <hi>Colour</hi> of Juſtice, or <hi>Malicious Detractions,</hi> I was not at all ſurpriſed with, and therefore the better prepared to ſuffer it; and ſeeing I could <hi>then</hi> expect <hi>no Relief,</hi> or <hi>juſt</hi> Satisfaction from thoſe, who were <hi>chief</hi> in impoſing the Injuries I ſuffer'd; I thought that <hi>a time for me</hi> (in this reſpect) <hi>to keep Silence.</hi> But ſince God (by our preſent Sovereign) hath mercifully removed <hi>ſuch Oppreſſions;</hi> I think <hi>now is the time to ſpeak,</hi> and not ſuffer to go unanſwered ſuch Malicious and Infamous Calumnies, repreſenting me the very worſt of <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and deſerving <hi>far Worſe</hi> uſage than ever Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent; and this ſaid, not by a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many.</hi> Wherefore out of a <hi>juſt</hi> Self-regard (which every Man owes to himſelf) I thought I was <hi>in Duty bound</hi> to endeavour ſome way or other, to <hi>clear my ſelf to the World from being that profligate Villain,</hi> I have been as <hi>induſtriouſly</hi> as <hi>maliciouſly</hi> Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOURS of the 10th inſtant came the laſt night to my hands; and I give you many thanks for your kindneſs therein expreſſed; and more particularly, that you have ſo often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reſcue me from the ſlanders of ſuch, as without either knowing my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Offence, have given me thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and unjuſt terms, worſe than which, the greateſt Offenders can hardly deſerve. <hi>Sir,</hi> Your Countrey is not the only place where I have been ſo traduced: but my misfortunes having made my Name known where in perſon I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been, and my Adverſaries being as malicious as numerous, I have heard from other hands, That I have elſewhere met with the like treatment. But to do my ſelf that Juſtice which I think is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me, in order to the clearing my ſelf from thoſe undeſerved Calumnies with which I have been, and am daily ſlandered, I have herein ſent you a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account of <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>for what</hi> I did ſo unjuſtly ſuffer under our late Male-adminiſtration. And ſeeing the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable late Committee of Lords (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to examine into the Death of the Right Honourable <hi>Arthur</hi> (late) Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) is diſſolved, by the laſt Diſſolution of Parliament, and moſt of the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Examinations taken before this Honourable Committee have been read before the Honourable Houſe of Lords, (and ſo no longer to be thought a Secret). I do humbly conceive it's neither an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or divulging a Secret, to publiſh what (ſince this happy Revolution) hath been proved for the clearing of <hi>That Truth which</hi> (when I firſt engaged) <hi>to aſſert, was the higheſt Offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Proceedings before this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Committee, you will in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perceive what great pains thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſons have been at, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Committees which have herein ſat, and the many Examinations taken before their Lordſhips: All which had long ſince been publiſhed to the World, had it not been for the Prorogations and Diſſolution which have happened, depending this Proſecution. But when the Honourable Houſe of Lords ſhall think fit to revive this Committee, and order this Report to be made, I hope I ſhall have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to vindicate my ſelf in ſome other way than at preſent is proper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Tho this Letter may at firſt ſight ſeem much longer than you think the Subject-matter required; yet when you ſhall have read the whole, and obſerved the numerous Examinations and Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which herein have been made, what induſtrious and villanous Oppoſitions it hath met with, not only in falſe Reports and ſly Inſinuations, but the many falſe Oaths which have been procured, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the belief of this barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you will (I hope) not find this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56409:7"/> Diſcourſe ſo tedious in its peruſal, as at the firſt glance you may fear it will prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> With the leave of a late Author upon this Subject, I have freely borrow'd of that Diſcourſe: Yet in all parts not obſerved his Method; but according to your Command, ſhall begin with the Reaſons that moved me to this Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In order to which, I ſhall in the firſt place give you a ſhort Relation of my Lord's Commitment to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with the Depoſitions taken before the Coroner upon my Lord's Body; for the reading thoſe Depoſitions proved the occaſion of my firſt engaging herein.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That my Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>called for a Penknife to pare his Nails; but the Penknife not being ready, his Lordſhip required a Razor, which was delivered him; with which Razor his Lordſhip retired to his Cloſet, and locked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in: But ſoon after, the Cloſet-door being opened, my Lord was found with his Throat cut through both Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Arteries, to the Neck-bone, and the Razor (as before delivered) ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Informations taken by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner were publiſhed the next <hi>Monday</hi> after my Lord's Death; and I the 16th of <hi>July</hi> buying one of theſe, that very Morning (with one Mr. <hi>William Hatſel</hi>) went to <hi>Wanſtead,</hi> to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>John Evans,</hi> (then an Officer of the Cuſtom-Houſe). Upon reading the laſt part of <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Information, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>That when they opened my Lord's Cloſet-door, they found his Lordſhip on the ground, with his Throat cut, AND THE RAZOR BY HIM;</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That could not be true; for <hi>Friday</hi> morning about Ten of the Clock, being upon the Cuſtom-houſe-Key with one Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> told him (with ſeveral others), <q>That his Son being in the <hi>Tower</hi> that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt before the Death of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was known, he was ſtanding juſt over-againſt the Earl's Chamber-window, and ſaw a bloody Razor thrown out of that Window; which he went to take up; but a Maid came out of Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe, and took it, and forthwith ran with it into my Lord's Lodgings, and up Stairs immediately, ſeveral times cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and then coming down, pretended the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon hearing Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> give this Relation, I declared, If this was true, what was ſworn before the Coroner muſt be falſe; and I did not believe they had ſworn falſe for nothing; but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Lord was murdered. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I did deſire the ſaid Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me where this Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> lived; for I proteſted, I would enquire into the matter. Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> then told me, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> lived in <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> by the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came to Town that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, about Six of the Clock, I did forthwith acquaint ſeveral of my Friends with my Deſign of making immediate enquiry into the Truth of this Story; which if I found reaſon to believe, I thought it was proper to be taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath before ſome Juſtice of Peace, in order to a further enquiry. By moſt of my Acquaintance I was diſſwaded from it; they telling me, That if my Lord was indeed murdered, the Perſons and Intereſt concerned in the Murther were too Powerful for me to engage; and therefore I muſt expect nothing but Ruine by medling in the matter. To all which diſſwaſions, I generally gave this Anſwer: That I would do nothing herein, but what I could juſtifie to God and a good Conſcience: And the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ruine I did not fear, or would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be deterred; for if my Lord was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed barbarouſly murdered, the ſame Principles and Practices that murdered him, might take off many of thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſons they then had, or ſhould take into Cuſtody, and pretend, as they did in this Caſe, That this was done by the Priſoners themſelves, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void an Infamous Execution: So that God only knew in how many Mens Deſtruction ſuch treacherous practices might determine. But if thoſe bloody
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56409:9"/> Men once found, that ſuch their Deſign was ſuſpected, and like to be detected, in all probability, they would deſiſt from the like villanous Practices; and ſeeing this would be more for the Intereſt of the Publick, than I could poſſibly be either in my Liberty, or otherwiſe, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Sacrifice that, and whatſoever elſe I had, to the Service of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>My Friends finding me thus reſolved to engage, they adviſed me at firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Lords Honourable Family here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and to obſerve ſuch Directions as from them I ſhould receive; wherefore that very <hi>Monday</hi> Evening, I went to St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Square</hi> to my Lords Houſe, where I found Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> under great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by reaſon of that deplorable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I did inform Sir <hi>Henry</hi> of what I had heard, but told him, That I had not then ſpoken either with the Boy, or his Father, who (as I was informed) lived in <hi>Mark-Lane</hi> by the <hi>Tower;</hi> and if Sir <hi>Henry</hi> thought fit, I would the next Morning go with any whom he ſhould appoint, to Diſcouſe the Father and Him; Sir <hi>Henry</hi> thanked me for my Information, but ſaid he was then under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for ſo great a Misfortune, as had herein befaln his Family, that he hardly knew what he did or ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next Morning I went to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> to whom, as ſoon as I had told the cauſe of my coming, the old Man ſeemed much ſurprized and concerned, and in Tears told me he was Ruin'd; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That I did ſuppoſe he was not ignorant what great things the Father of this Unfortunate Lord had done, and ſuffered for His Majeſties Intereſt, and how this very Lord himſelf had been highly in His Majeſties Favour, having been imployed in Places of the greateſt Honour and Truſt; and therefore, if his Lordſhip fell by treacherous Hands, none (in reaſon) could be ſuppoſed ſo zealous for a Diſcovery, as His Majeſty would, who could protect him from whatſoever Danger might ſeem to threaten him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if there were any Danger, I ſtood principally ſubject to it; but the Danger I did not fear, conſidering of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence this might prove, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into; at length Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> gave me the ſame Information (in ſubſtance) I had the day before received from Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi> I then deſired to ſee his Son, who being then at School, I could not ſpeak with him; but that Afternoon about Two of the Clock I went again, and was then told, That the Boy had denied all, which denial was occaſioned hy his Siſters telling him, <hi>He ſhould be Hang'd for what he had herein declared;</hi> this the Siſter could not deny; but as ſoon as the Boy was called into the Parlour, where I with ſeveral others were, before I queſtioned him about it, I diſcourſed him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danget of a Lye; and after I had ſolemnly enjoyned him to tell me the very Truth: The Boy then declared to me, as he did at firſt to his Father and Siſters, and told me, <hi>That his Siſters Threats had frightned him into a Denial.</hi> Upon this, I took in Writing the Subſtance of what the Boy declared, and the next day drew it into a formal Information, which followeth:</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56409:10"/> his Mother, to whom the Boy had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd it, as ſoon as he came from the <hi>Tower.</hi> My Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> ſeemed much ſurpriſed, and after ſome pauſe, told me, That I ſhould bring the Perſons (who were not then with me) the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>and if it were proper, he would take their Depoſitions.</hi>— The next Morning about Nine or Ten of the Clock, I went with the Boy and his Siſter, (the Mother not being well) to whom the Boy had likewiſe, as ſoon as he came from the <hi>Tower,</hi> revealed what he had as before ſeen. As ſoon as I came to the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Office, I ſent his Lordſhip word, that according to his Lordſhips Order, I did attend. Immediately upon which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſelf, or either of the Informants were examined) Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came to the Office, and took me into Cuſtody; the only Inſtance where ſuch as came to give Information on the behalf of the King,<note place="margin">Note.</note> were ſo treated before any Accuſation againſt them) and ſome ſhort time after, thus in Cuſtody, I was called in before the then King and Council.</p>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) asked, was, What made me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in that mater? To which I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That I was altogether unrelated to, and unacquainted with that Honourable Family; ſo that there lay no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Obligation upon me firſt to move, than upon any Man whatever, who might have met with the like Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but it was my love to Truth and Juſtice firſt ingaged me in it; and through the Grace of God, my Duty therein I would do, though death ſtared me in the face every ſtep I made. I can't but here obſerve the carriage of the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who with a concerned Countenance, leaning his Elbow upon the board, covered his Face with his Hand, upon which I did immediately imagine, that ſomewhat within did more trouble him, than all the trouble from without did me; for though I ſtood as the ſuppoſed Criminal, I had reaſon to gueſs —<hi>ſomebody elſe</hi> was the real one. I did then obſerve to His Majeſty the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence and Contradictions ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Coroner by <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who were the Perſons that pretended to prove the Self-murther before the Coroner; upon which his Highneſs called for thoſe Informations, but ſaid nothing in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; His Majeſty then took them, and ſaid as little; but the then Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> having read them, went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thoſe Incoherences and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; upon which I did object againſt what his Lordſhip ſaid, as inſufficient, and further urged the Objections I had before made. His Lordſhip ſeemed very angry that I made thoſe Reflections; but, with ſubmiſſion, I think, by printing the Coroner's Depoſitions, every man was in ſome ſort appealed to, whether what was ſo ſworn, and printed, was not ſufficient to induce every impartial Perſon (for ſuch the Coroner and Jury ought to have been) that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cut his own Throat; and the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe great Incoherences, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Depoſitions, argued as great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy in the Authority that publiſhed them, as the depoſing them did villany in the Informants, or the believing them want of underſtanding (not to ſay hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, integrity and impartiality) in the Coroner, and moſt of the Jury. After ſome time ſpent in the Examination, I was ordered to withdraw into the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's Office, and repeated Orders given by the then King, that I ſhould be kept cloſe (perhaps that I might not hear the Boy, or his Siſter examined) the Boy was then called in, and at firſt (as I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards informed) did not deny the truth of his Information; but being not then paſt Thirteen, and frighted by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before ſo great Authority, he wept; upon which his then Majeſty ſtroked him upon the Head, and ſaid, <hi>did you not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56409:10"/> this to excuſe your truenting?</hi> To which the Boy trembling, anſwered, <hi>yes</hi> (this the Boy declared at home after his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination). Then the Siſter was called, who declared how the Boy, upon his firſt coming from the <hi>Tower,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her as before ſet forth; and tho after threatned to be whipt, never retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted till the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> when I having been there, his Siſter had frighted him into a denial, which as ſoon as I came the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, he retracted, and ſtood to his firſt Information, ſaying, his Siſter had frighted him, and told him he ſhould be hanged, and his Father would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; the fear of which made him deny it: She further declared, that ſhe did verily believe they never knew or heard of me till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> after my Lord's death, and that I never did give, or offer her Brother one Farthing, but ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined him to ſpeak nothing but the truth, (this the Siſter did after declare was the ſubſtance of her Examination). After the Siſter's Examination was over, I was the ſecond time called for, and told by my Lord Keeper, that I would have ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Boy; to which I anſwered, that I was well ſatisfied of my Innocency in, and abhorrence of all ſuch Practices, which in this caſe appeared impoſſible, ſeeing the Relation of the Boy was ſeveral days before I ever ſaw or heard of the Boy; nevertheleſs I was ready to give what Bail his Lordſhip ſhould be pleas'd to command; upon which I was ordered to give Bonds with Two Securities in Two thouſand Pound apiece; this I did that very afternoon; but the omiſſion of the Under-Secretary, in the form of theſe Bonds, was very advantageous to me, and my Security; for whereas the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Council-bonds were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>and in the mean time to be of the good behaviour;</hi> this Clauſe in mine was left out, by which my Friends were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that, which otherwiſe would (as you will afterwards find) have ruined them. Standing thus under Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound to anſwer to an Information of Subornation, I thought I was in Self-juſtice bound to make what further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I could, to ſtrengthen the Boy's Evidence. To which my Lord Keeper (without the leaſt colour) ſuggeſted, I did endeavour to ſuborn the Boy to ſwear. In this Inquiry I was dayly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down, and found moſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple afraid to diſcover what they herein knew; and which was more, few of my Acquantance could I prevail with to go with me upon theſe Inquiries; for my Misfortunes, with the danger that from the corruption of the then Times naturally threatned men, deterred all from engaging any ways herein. But at length I met with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Cragg.</note> who readily went with me upon all occaſions. In a conſtant ſearch after many particulars (which would be too tedious here to repeat) I was likewiſe informed of a Girl that had alſo ſeen the bloody Razor, as before, thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window; upon which I went to St. <hi>Katherine</hi>'s, where the Girl lived, and ſeveral Perſons being preſent, I took in writing what ſhe could ſay herein, and what her Aunt and Mr. <hi>Glaſebrook,</hi> to whom ſhe related it as ſhe came from the <hi>Tower,</hi> could teſtify; which Relation was as followeth.</p>

            <p>About this time I was informed, That the Report of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death was at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> about Nine of the Clock that very Morning he died, whenas my Lord's Death was not known in the <hi>Tower</hi> till about Nine; whereupon I rid to <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> but I found the perſon very ſhy, and unwilling to appear in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I had no ſooner returned to <hi>London,</hi> but I was told, the ſame Report was at <hi>Marleborough</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> (about 70 Miles from <hi>London</hi>) the very morning of the Earl's death; whereupon I rid to <hi>Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> reſolving to trace the Report as near as I could to the Author. When I came to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> I met with one <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah Burgis,</hi> whom before this I never to my remembrance ſaw or heard of; who declared, That the very Morning my Lord died, he was at <hi>Froome</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire</hi> (about 30 miles diſtant from <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and an hundred miles from <hi>London</hi>) and being there at the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> he was informed that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower.</hi> I did deſire <hi>Burgis</hi> to write me a Letter to the Maſter of the Houſe at <hi>Froome,</hi> to inform me (if he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) who it was that reported this at his Houſe. I did at <hi>Marlborough</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpeak with one <hi>Lewis,</hi> who did alſo inform me, <q>That about Two of the Clock the day the Earl died, as he was riding up <hi>Husbands-Hill,</hi> (not far from <hi>Andover</hi>) he overtook a Gentleman, riding a very eaſie Traveller's pace; and as they were diſcourſing of the News in the Countrey, the Gentleman ſaid, He had heard a report of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that he had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower:</hi> But the Gentleman was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a Stranger to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not inform me <hi>how</hi> or <hi>where</hi> to find him.</q> With <hi>Burgis</hi> his Letter I was riding to <hi>Froom:</hi> but when I came within about ſix miles of the place, at a Town called <hi>Bradford,</hi> I ſtopt at an Inn-door to drink a Glaſs of Cyder;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56409:11"/> upon which, one <hi>Beach</hi> an Attorney, (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in his Countrey and Generation) informed a Juſtice of Peace then there, That I looked like a diſaffected perſon, by wearing Band and Cuffs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that dangerous Time I ought to be examined; upon which, the Juſtice came out to examine me, and there came with him one who knew me, ſo that the Juſtice ſeemed well ſatisfied: But <hi>Beach</hi> taking the Juſtice aſide, tells him, That he ought to be more ſtrict, and ſearch me; for by my wearing Band and Cuffs, it was plain I was diſaffected to the Government, (of this I have been often told by ſome then there); upon which the Juſtice told me, He muſt ſearch me. When I perceived this, I thought it proper to give the Juſtice a particular Account of the Occaſion of my being in the Countrey; as alſo, what Papers I had about me; which Papers being read, after ſome Debate, and adviſing with <hi>Beach,</hi> he made a Warrant for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, the Form whereof, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, was the moſt Illegal I ever ſaw.</p>

            <p>It was long before I could prevail with the Juſtice to let me hear my War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant read; but when I told him by the Statute I would have a Copy of it within ſix hours after I was brought to Gaol,<note place="margin">31 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</note> he read it to me; finding the Concluſion to be ſo Arbitrary, I told him he could not juſtify his Warrant; which ſhould the Jaylor obey, I might be kept a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner during life. For I was not to be admitted to Pen, Ink or Paper, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, till the Jaylor heard from the King and Council, without which I muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in Priſon without Conviction or Tryal: I told him, That all ſuch Warrants of Commitment ought to conclude, <hi>till he be diſcharged by due courſe of Law;</hi> but the Juſtice told me he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Legality of his Warrant. By vertue of this Warrant I was carried to <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Gaol (about 30 miles diſtant from <hi>Bradford</hi>) where I found the Keeper of more ſenſe or honeſty than either his Worſhip, or his Cabal; for there were ſeveral Attorneys in the Inn when I was examined; (with whom Mr. Juſtice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed) for the Goaler told me, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſtrictneſs of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56409:12"/> I ſhould diſcourſe with whom I would, himſelf being by; and write to whom I would whilſt he was preſent and ſaw it. Thanking my Keeper for this Civility, I did immediately demand a Copy of my Commitment, and writ to <hi>London</hi> for my <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> thereupon, which within ſome ſhort time I received, and was brought to <hi>London</hi> to be bailed; but all the Judges being out of Town, I was, according as the Statute herein directs, to be carried before my Lord Keeper <hi>(North);</hi> but his Lordſhip ordered the Goaler to bring me before him at the Council that Afternoon; as ſoon as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared before his Lordſhip, my Lord ſeemed well pleaſed at a ſuppoſed, but miſtaken advantage he thought to have had againſt my Bail; for his Lordſhip ſmiling, told me, notwithſtanding he did not expect that I ſhould have had much regard to my ſelf, yet he did believe I would have had that juſt reſpect to my Bail, as not to ruine them by thoſe new matters then to be laid to my Charge. To which I anſwered, I knew not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I had prejudiced my Bail, of whom the only thing required was my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the then next Term, which (if God permit) I would do, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify them: No, replied his Lordſhip (ſmiling) the good behaviour was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe required; A notorious breach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appears in theſe matters you ſtand afreſh charged with. I did humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Bonds themſelves, and in the Condition there appeared the Omiſſion before obſerved. For which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was very angry with Secretary <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> who immediately transferred the blame thereof to his under-Secretary. When his Lordſhip found, that by this neglect my Bail was ſlipt from his hands, his Lordſhip was reſolved to hold me faſt enough; and therefore demanded Bonds with Sureties in Twelve thouſand pounds, for my Appearance, and as much more Security for the Good Behaviour. I did hereupon deſire his Lordſhip, That he would conſider the Statute upon which I then came to be Bailed; and, as that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute required, his Lordſhip would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Quality, and the nature of my Offence: As for the firſt, I was a younger Brother, and my Father living; and as to the ſecond, the pretended Crime, it was of the very ſame nature with that under which I ſtood bound with Sureties in Two thouſand pound for my Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. My Lord Keeper reply'd, That according to the Statute, he did conſider both my <hi>Condition</hi> and the <hi>Offence,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated his Demands accordingly; for had I been an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> my Quality anſwerable to the Crime, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Six thouſand pound his Lordſhip would have demanded Twenty; ſo that then I muſt have given Eighty thouſand pound Bonds in Bail and Suretyſhip; which (to the beſt of my remembrance) is twice as much as I ever yet heard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of any Nobleman in <hi>England,</hi> though under a Commitment of High-Treaſon. Whilſt I was before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, I deſired his Lordſhip, that ſome of thoſe Witneſſes might be ſent for out of the Countrey where the Report was of the Earl's having cut his own Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> before his Lordſhip was dead. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, one of the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (to the beſt of my remembrance, the now Marqueſs of <hi>Hallifax</hi>) ſaid, <hi>This is juſt as it was in the Caſe of Sir</hi> Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey. But the Lord Keeper, I found, would not ſend for Witneſſes to <hi>prove</hi> what his buſineſs was induſtriouſly and oppreſſively to <hi>ſtifle.</hi> Not being able to comply with theſe hard terms, I was remanded to <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>-Gaol: But that night lying in Town, I read the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and adviſed with ſome of my Friends, who found that the Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour could not be demanded, but that Bail to anſwer the Cauſe of Commitment, was all the Statute did require. I did therefore the next morning deſire my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56409:12"/> Keeper to carry me to his Lordſhip's Houſe in <hi>Great-Queen-ſtreet;</hi> and for the Reaſons before obſerved, I did hope his Lordſhip would not inſiſt either upon the Good Behaviour, or yet upon ſo great Bail. My Keeper accordingly carried me: But before his Lordſhip that time ſaw me, my Keeper did acquaint his Lordſhip with the Occaſion of his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me once more before his Lordſhip. Upon which, the Lord Keeper ſent for me, and told me, That the Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour he neither did or could require; and if I would give Bail to anſwer my Commitment, I might have my Liberty. To which I replied, That in ſo large a Sum as was demanded, I could not; but in all would give Ten thouſand pound Bail, which I hoped his Lordſhip would judge ſufficient. His Lordſhip ſaid, What was agreed upon at the Council, he could not there change: but my Keeper ſhould bring me down that afternoon to the Council; and if there it could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, I ſhould be bailed. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon I did accordingly attend the Council, where I found his Lordſhip's mind changed, and returned to his firſt Demand, Twelve thouſand pound for my Appearance, and Twelve thouſand pound more for my Good Behaviour; notwithſtanding that very morning he had (as before) declared he could not by Law require it.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip did repreſent my Offence ſuch as deſerved the greateſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told me, Such Practices might ſhorten my days, (or words to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect). I replied, That I was not conſcious of my having done any thing which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a <hi>Priſon,</hi> much leſs <hi>Death:</hi> but the manner of Death I did not fear; and if in the way of my duty I met it, I could as chearfully die at <hi>Tyburn</hi> in a <hi>Halter,</hi> as in my <hi>Bed</hi> of a <hi>Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſuffered in the defect of this Act, I cannot but here take notice of one great Omiſſion in this Statute. This Act inflicts a Penalty of One hundred pound upon the Gaoler that denies the Priſoner, or any on his behalf, a Copy of his Warrant; and Five hundred pound Penalty on every Judge that refuſes to grant an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the Statute, for the removal of ſuch Priſoners; but inflicts no certain Penalty upon the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to bail the Priſoner that ſhall upon this Act be brought before them; ſo that if the Judge either demand Ten times more than the Quality of the Priſoner, or the Nature of the Offence requires, or refuſeth to take any Bail whatſoever, there can no Action of Five hundred pound for this refuſal be brought, for no Penalty in this Caſe is enacted. It's very ſtrange, that the Statute ſhould lay ſo great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties upon the denial of the means of Bail, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Copy of the Warrant, and <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> and yet not enact an expreſs Penalty for refuſal of the end, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Bailing the Priſoner; for what ſignifies either a Copy of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> thereupon, if Bail be not procured? This is the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Priſoner to a very fruitleſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, ſeeing the Statute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Judge ſhall Bail the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, taking Recognizance with one or more Sureties, according to the Quality of the Perſon, and Nature of the Offence, a Special Action of the Caſe lies againſt ſuch Judge upon his refuſal: But if there be little Damages ſuſtained, as it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; for though one Judge refuſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may grant the Priſoner his Liberty upon Bail, and conſequently ſo proved, the Jury being ſworn to go according to Evidence, as well in the Damages, as in the matter directly in Iſſue, muſt go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Proof, unleſs they think the extravagant Verdicts of late Times, (which found One hundred thouſand pounds, where not one Farthing was proved), will excuſe them, in giving Fifty times more than was ſworn to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56409:13"/> ſuſtained. Few words more in the Statute would I humbly conceive, have ſufficiently provided in this Caſe; for in the Statute, wherein it is ſaid, That <hi>if the Judges ſhall deny any Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>by this Act required to be granted, being moved for as aforeſaid,</hi> (it had been added, <hi>or ſhall refuſe ſuch Bail as the Quality of the Priſoner and Nature of the Offence requires), they ſhall ſeverally forfeit to the Priſoner or Party grieved the Sum of Five hundred pound, to be recovered in manner aforeſaid:</hi> Theſe few words would have given the Five hundred pound for refuſal of Bail, as well as denying the <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> whereas without the like Clauſe, the Statute may (in effect) be daily evaded.—To return.</p>

                  </gap>ſhire,</hi> I was turned over to Mr. <hi>Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> the Meſſenger, where upwards of five Weeks, I lay at no leſs Charge than 4 <hi>l.</hi> and odd Money <hi>per</hi> Week directly, beſides other Collateral Expences; this being too great for my Fortune to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, I was adviſed to remove my ſelf to the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> but before-hand, to agree with the Marſhal upon Security, to have the Liberty of the Rules; this I did by a Friend, who told me, That upon giving the Marſhal 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Security for my faithful Impriſonment, and 5 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week Chamber-Rent, he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to allow me the Liberty of the Rules. Whereupon (after ſome Oppoſition) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved my ſelf; but the Marſhal I found falſe to his Promiſe, for he having got me into his Cuſtody, demanded two Men for my Security in 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, and 10 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week, Chamber-rent, and then aſſured me, I ſhould have the Liberty of the Rules. To theſe Terms (ſo much above our firſt Agreement) I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But the Marſhal the ſecond time unjuſtly diſappointed me; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Security and Chamber-rent, I was ordered to be kept cloſe Priſoner at no leſs Charge, than 2 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week; and under this ſtrict Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Marſhal refuſed to give me back my Security-bonds, which at laſt I was forced with Guineas to redeem. For this ſevere and unjuſt Uſage, the Marſhal pretended the ſpecial Order of the then Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> before whom at the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar,</hi> I was the then next Term bailed; after which, with all poſſible Induſtry and Diligence, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my former Inquiries. But about the 12th of that <hi>November,</hi> I was taken up by the City-Marſhal, by Virtue of a Warrant of the Lord Mayor, or Court of Aldermen, as Illegal in the Cauſe, as the other was in the Concluſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment: for the only Cauſe (if it can properly be ſo called) in the Warrant, was, <hi>My being ſuſpected to be Diſaffected to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> finding the words ſo general, and not one particular Inſtance to juſtify that Suſpition of Diſaffection, I could at firſt give no probable gueſs at the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By the City-Marſhal I was firſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> and after that, the then Lord Mayor, before whom I refuſed to anſwer ſuch general Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were asked, without ſeeing my Accuſer, and hearing my Accuſation; but I ſoon found what was the pretence of my Commitment, which I had grounds to ſuſpect, was deſigned to be ſtretched to the higheſt Offence, nothing leſs than Treaſon; for I was charged with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking ſeveral Hundreds of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant-Flails,</hi> with a Deſign therewith to Maſſacre the Kings (then called) Loyal Subjects. Refuſing to anſwer the Lord Mayors Queſtions, I was committed to Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who was ordered forthwith to carry me before the King and Council; as ſoon as I came there, my old Friend, the Lord Keeper <hi>North,</hi> began to interrogate me in ſeveral Particulars; but I refuſed to anſwer any, till I ſaw my Accuſer, and heard my Accuſation; his Lordſhip told me, my not anſwering that Honourable Board, was a contempt, for which I might be proſecuted. To
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56409:13"/> which I replied with Submiſſion, <q>I did not underſtand I was obliged in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Law, to anſwer to any Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till I came judicially to be tryed, where I ſhould both ſee the Accuſer, and hear my Accuſation.</q> At length the King ordered my Accuſer to be called in, whoſe Charge (in Subſtance) was this, (viz.) <q>That ſuch a time, about four Years and a half before, I came to his Shop, and beſpoke a <hi>Pocket-Flail;</hi> which by Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I did order him to make; the next day after I beſpake three more, which I was to fetch the third day.</q> And did likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <q>He ſhould make me ſeveral hundreds, but I came not according to my Promiſe for either of the three, or did he make any of that number I pretended to beſpeak.</q> That <q>I did beſpeak one, and the next day three, I did confeſs to be true, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fetched one of the three the third day; but theſe not being made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Direction, I would not have the other two. As for the Five hundred, or any ſuch Number I ſhould beſpeak, I did declare, (as the Truth was) that part of the Charge was very Malicious and Falſe.</q> Major <hi>Richardſon</hi> being then there, as fooliſhly as maliciouſly, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to fruſtrate my Defence; for he told His Majeſty, the true Cauſe I came not according to my Promiſe for any of that great number I had beſpoke, he would give His Majeſty. For Captain <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> declared, <q>That almoſt three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he had been in that Turners Shop, where ſeeing one of thoſe Inſtruments (it being the firſt that he ever ſaw) he demanded of the Turner what he called them; who anſwered, A <hi>Pocket-Flail;</hi> and then further told him, 'That the Gentleman for whom he made the firſt above a year before, pretended he would then have ſeveral hundreds made, and beſpoke three Flails after the firſt, but came not for either of the three, or any of that number which he pretended he did want.</q> Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared upon this, <q>He did believe there was a general Deſign againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore he did Charge the Turner, That if the Gentleman came according to his Promiſe, he ſhould endeavour to ſecure him; which Caution he did ſuppoſe I had heard of, and therefore came not according to my Promiſe.</q> Of this moſt ridiculous Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, I took immediate advantage, and told His Majeſty what the Captain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, could not poſſibly be true, even by his own Suggeſtion. For he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That the Turner told him when he firſt ſaw the Flail, that I had beſpoke a great Number above a year before, and was forthwith to have fetched one of them, but came not according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and yet the Captain alledges, That his Caution ſo long after given, did influence my not coming a year and a half before. Immediately upon this, the King ſaw this Charge mixt with ſuch folly and falſhood, that His Majeſty thought fit to order my immediate Diſcharge. As ſoon as I came into the Room next the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> took me by the Hand, and proteſted he was extreamly glad I was diſcharged; but conſidering his good Service, in juſt before endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prevent it, I gave little Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this Aſſurance. Being once more at Liberty, I continued, as before, my Inquiries, in which I was daily hurried up and down; for having made it my buſineſs to get the Names of moſt of the Soldiers upon Duty that day my Lord was Murthered, I was in a conſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after ſome of them; for I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by ſome Information I had received, to believe that not a few could ſpeak not only to the throwing out of the Bloody Razor, but to that which was more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, the ſending in the Ruffians to my Lord, and from whom thoſe Villains went commiſſioned. But as I ſpoke with any of thoſe Soldiers, I perceived them very ſhy, and denied to me, what they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56409:14"/> had before freely confeſſed to their inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Acquaintance; and afterwards told their Friends, they would not be brought into trouble, by teſtifying their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therein, which they knew would moſt certainly prove their Ruin.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was Priſoner in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> I (with the reſt of the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners) was ſeveral times ſearch'd; but having ſtill notice ſome ſhort time before ſuch Search, I conveyed away ſuch Papers, as being ſeized, might have tended to my Prejudice. But in ſuch hurries, I loſt a Liſt of ſuch Names that could have declared that which was not a little material to this Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hillary</hi> Term 83. Mr. <hi>Speake</hi> and my ſelf were tried upon an Information; the ſubſtance whereof was, <q>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Arthur</hi> late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the 13th of <hi>July</hi>

But when this <hi>Cloud</hi> appeared, it conſiſted in Major <hi>Hawley</hi> (at whoſe Houſe my Lord was murthered) <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the Warder who then kept the Chamber-door) <hi>Bomeny</hi> my Lord's Servant, (then attending on his Lordſhip) and <hi>Lloyd</hi> the Sentinel (who kept the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Door whilſt my Lord was murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed).

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56409:14"/> Earl himſelf, feloniouſly, and as a Felon of himſelf, did kill and murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How very ridiculous would it have looked, ſhould the then Court, or King's Council have thus ſpoke to thoſe Three Witneſſes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <q>Gentlemen, <hi>YOU</hi> (being three of the men in whoſe Cuſtody my Lord was at the time of his death) <hi>are</hi> deſigned to be charged by the Defendants <hi>Speake</hi> and <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with the murther of my Lord; but <hi>WE</hi> have thought it <hi>convenient</hi> and <hi>JUST</hi> by <hi>YOU</hi> to prove, that <hi>YOUR SELVES</hi> did <hi>not</hi> murther this unfortunate Lord, but that this Lord himſelf feloniouſly, and as a Felon of himſelf, did kill and murther, as <hi>UPON ONLY SOME OF<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation before the Coroner, which are at large herein before printed.</note> YOUR DEPOSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS</hi> he hath been already found by the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Inquiſition. Do <hi>YOU</hi> therefore upon Oath but <hi>purge YOUR SELVES,</hi> and lay this Murther to my Lord's own door, and <hi>WE</hi> will inflict exemplary puniſhment upon theſe Defendants, whoſe Conſpiracy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the charging <hi>YOU</hi> as Actors in it, or Privy thereunto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do humbly conceive, that all this was virtually included in the Examination of thoſe Witneſſes, <hi>whoſe Oaths</hi> were not only admitted to <hi>purge themſelves,</hi> but to render ſuch as Criminals as ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to charge them. Should the like be practiſed in <hi>protection</hi> of all <hi>accuſed</hi> (I am well ſatisfied) no man would turn <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, <hi>THESE</hi> (being <hi>the men</hi> attending on my Lord at the time of his death, and his Lordſhip then a cloſe Priſoner) are <hi>the perſons</hi> to be preſumed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to what was <hi>done BY his Lordſhip</hi> juſt before his death, and therefore <hi>the parties</hi> which as to that could be ſworn.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, As they were <hi>THE MEN</hi> which were to be preſumed privy to what was done <hi>BY</hi> his Lordſhip juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, becauſe they were <hi>the perſons</hi> whoſe Stations were ſo near his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> for <hi>this very reaſon</hi> they were <hi>THE PARTIES</hi> which were likewiſe to be ſuppoſed privy to what was done <hi>TO HIS LORDSHIP</hi> juſt before his death; and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that his Lordſhip fell by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Violence, theſe were <hi>THE MEN</hi> muſt be preſumed conuſant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherefore <hi>theſe</hi> mens Teſtimony being in effect a <hi>Self-diſcharge,</hi> ought not here to have been admitted.</p>
            <p>With all ſubmiſſion to that great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Judgment and Policy, which drew and managed this Information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Speak,</hi> and my ſelf, I think herein the managers of this Proſecution extremely failed in their proof; for Mr. <hi>Speake,</hi> and my ſelf, being accuſed with falſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſpiring <hi>to charge thoſe in whoſe cuſtody my Lord was,</hi> with murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord; The Duty incumbent on the then King's (or rather <hi>DUKE</hi>'s) Council was to prove, That we, or one of us, did uſe indirect means, by Bribes, Threats, or the like, to procure thoſe Falſe Witneſſes; and this (or whatever elſe was brought to prove this Information) ought to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not by ſuch as <hi>appeared in Court</hi> (in effect) <hi>with Halters about their necks to ſwear for their OWN lives; being virtually told, This do, and you ſhall live; but in the day ye fail thereof, ye ſhall ſurely die:</hi> But this Information ought to have been teſtified by men who ſtood <hi>recti in Curia,</hi> which were neither themſelves to be hanged for murthering my Lord, provided they would not (by conſequence) prove he did murder himſelf; or to be not only ſaved, but well rewarded in caſe they did (though contradictorily) confirm the ſame.</p>
            <p>As for all thoſe Witneſſes which were produced againſt us, to prove any Bribes, or the like, I do ſuppoſe Prejudice it ſelf will not pretend to ſay, that by the Trial (which none can believe Sir <hi>George Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> would order partially, in our favour, to be printed) the leaſt colour of proof is given by any.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56409:15"/>
            <p>That Nation is happy whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwers the true end of Governours, (viz.) <hi>To be terrors to Evil-doers, and a praiſe to thoſe that do well;</hi> but when once this end is inverted, and Juſtice (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which a Corrupt Court falſly calls ſo) becomes a <hi>SKREEN</hi> to Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and puniſhment inflicted on thoſe who would puniſh them, then is that Kingdom in a much worſe condition than it could be by the ſtate of Nature. For Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice thus corrupted, would prove as fatal to the Body Politick, as the poiſoning all Drugs, Simples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Natural.</p>
            <p>This by the perverſion of all Law and Juſtice would probably have proved our general Fate, had not God (in mercy) by our preſent Sovereign, removed the Source hereof. —But to return.</p>
            <p>Upon my Tryal, I did expect all that the moſt inveterate and milicious Rage could utter, and therefore was not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with all that Fury, and unjuſt Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracy, that appeared in the Court; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the MOUTH thereof; for in the midſt of his Rage, when I was falſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the moſt odious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, worſe than a Common Robber, or Burglar (for theſe Mens Crimes tended only to a private Miſchief, but mine to a general Confuſion); I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling upon the then remembrance of this Story. A Neighbour of mine, whom long ſince I knew in the Country, an illiterate plain Country Farmer, who had a Wife of as violent Spirit as liv'd; and one day ſhe came into the Room where her Husband was (with ſeveral Neighbours); as ſoon as She came, tho there was not, or it ſeems had been, the leaſt colour for a provocation, for he ſtill carried himſelf well towards her, She flies into the greateſt Rage imaginable, calling him all the Names that Malice could invent, or Rage could utter; and had She not been prevailed upon, might have done him ſome Miſchief. The Husband in the midſt of this great Storm, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to be falſe with which the Fury of his Wife had charg'd him, ſtood as a Man altogether unconcern'd, and appear'd rather pleaſant than diſpleaſed. One of his Neighbours then ask'd him, How it was poſſible for him, ſo to receive the ſcurrilous and bitter Railing of that furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman? To which the Husband ſmilling, calmly replied, That his Wife talked of a Man he did not know; and therefore, what reaſon had he to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, when he was not the Perſon ſhe ſpoke of, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> I did ask my Conſcience, an Infallible Evidence, according to the Truth, to condemn or acquit, Whether I was this profligate Villain his Lordſhip did ſo infamouſly Characterize; and I found that impartial Judge (by whoſe Sentence at the laſt day I ſhall ſtand or fall) did acquit me from that Crime, which his Lordſhip's Corruption againſt his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief unjuſtly charged me with; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought I might well ſay to my ſelf, as that honeſt Countrey-fellow did to his Neighbours, <hi>I am not the man thus railed at;</hi> but his Lordſhip reviled a man I was not acquainted with, or knew, and therefore ſtood very much unconcerned at whatſoever his Lordſhip's corrupt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence falſly and malitiouſly (in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency to that bloody Deſign that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Murther) without the leaſt colour of Crime applied to me, who was as innocent of the Offence, as of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht ſtrained and groundleſs Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let any impartial man read the Tryal, and well obſerve what is ſworn, if in the Evidence he find the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an Offence, I dare ſuffer what I have already undergone; but if men will take the malicious and grounleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of a time-ſerving, mercenary Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the corrupt Charge of as corrupt a Judge for Evidence, they will find me painted in the worſt of colours. I did not expect that my Innocence would prove my protection againſt theſe unjuſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56409:15"/> and violent Proceedings, and therefore I might have ſaved my ſelf, and Friends, the troube of a Defence; and with that <hi>Welchman,</hi> who ſleeping at the Bar, whilſt the Evidence in a Capital Crime was ſwearing againſt him; and being awaked by his Friend, and adviſed to prepare for his Defence, ſtarts up, and rubs his Eyes, ſaying, <hi>If they have a mind to hang hur, they will hang hur whether hur make hur De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or no.</hi>— But deſiring in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſatisfy the World that there were ſtrong grounds to believe this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lord was treacherouſly butchered, I thought it proper to produce ſome Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in order thereunto; but when I found that ſome of theſe ſo produced, were ſo brow-beaten by the King's Council, and ſaw that they were afraid to teſtify the Truth, and upon Oath denied what I knew to be true, I thought it convenient not to produce many of theſe whom I had ſubpoened, becauſe they ſhould not be baffled, and ſpoiled by the Court; for ſhould any of theſe Witneſſes upon Oath (through fear) have denied what they knew to be true, and afterwards (when Truth in this caſe became not Criminal, which I did ſtill believe I ſhould live to ſee) teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the very truth, their former Denial would be produced to invalidate their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtimony, and ſo their Credit be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the great Council againſt me came into Court that Morning, I was tried, before ever the Information was read, he told me <hi>he would do my buſineſs;</hi> upon which I deſired he would have the patience to tarry till the Jury had done it to his hands; to which he replied, <hi>he did not doubt them;</hi> and I found by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he had no reaſon; for the Jury, without the leaſt proof, found me guilty of the whole matter charged upon me in the Information, and the Defendant <hi>Hugh Speake,</hi> guilty of all but the conſpiring to procure falſe Witneſſes, and of that they found him Not guilty.</p>
            <p>In this Verdict I ſtand only guilty, (could ſuch a thing be poſſible) of <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> to procure Falſe Witneſſes. It was never before known th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But Mr. Attorney-General at the Trial was pleaſed otherwiſe to expreſs it; for Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> tells the Court, They need but read Mr. <hi>Speake</hi>'s Letter, and they would find it ten times worſe than what Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had done. For which his Lordſhip ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very angry with the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General, and told him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Trial</hi> pag. 53.</note> None ſhould appear ſo great an Actor in the buſineſs as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip's Behaviour at this Trial was ſo very remarkable, that (as I have been informed by ſeveral) he was ſcarce ever ſeen more paſſionately to expreſs himſelf. And though my Trial ſhews great bitterneſs of expreſſion, yet it is not printed in all its parts as it was ſpoke, but ſome of the <hi>Billingſgate</hi>-railing left out; yet ſuch as it is, by his Lordſhip's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority publiſhed (I do humbly conceive) there have few, if any Trials been ſtuff d with ſuch foul-mouth'd Invectives. But his Lordſhip in this was to act <hi>counter</hi> to his Title; for though the Duty of his Place required his greateſt encouragement to the detection of Blood, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch vile Offenders, at this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>his buſineſs</hi> was quite different: For (as I have been long ſince informed) one day, not long after my Trial, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip having drunk very freely, upon ſome diſcourſe with relation to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56409:16"/> Earl's Death, a Gentleman took then an occaſion to tell his Lordſhip, That my Trial was excellently well managed by his Lordſhip and the whole Court. To which his Lordſhip made anſwer to this effect, <hi>(viz.) That though he was well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was murdered, his buſineſs was to ſtifle it.</hi> This Gentleman is altogether averſe from betraying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Converſation, by appearing as an Informer or Evidence in judicially expoſing what paſſed over a Glaſs of Wine; Whether the effects of Wine in this veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Proverb <hi>[In vino veritas),</hi> I know not: but it appeared notorious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unprejudiced, that there was juſt ground to believe his Lordſhip's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption did herein endeavour to ſtifle what his love (had he any) to Juſtice in the duty of his Place, ſhould have zealouſly ſtrove to detect.</p>
            <p>Under this Fine I lay Priſoner for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five years: But about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1687. <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi> came over to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to treat with ſeveral of the King's Priſoners, in order to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; and they brought with them a Liſt of ſuch Priſoners; in which Liſt perceiving my Name the ONLY Name croſſed, I did enquire how my Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo marked? To which I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That as ſoon as His (then) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had ſeen my Name, he called for a Pen and Ink, and with his own hand croſſed it; by which I perceived I was deſigned for <hi>Judgment,</hi> not <hi>Mercy;</hi> and upon application was ſo told; for I was inform'd, that no man was more obnoxious to His Majeſty than my ſelf, who was the only perſon that ever caſt Blood in his face: But if his own conſcience by a juſt application threw it there, I could not help that; I am ſure they that ſaid it, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Book; for nothing at my Trial, or at any time after proved againſt me, made any ſuch thing appear. I muſt confeſs, ſeveral Witneſſes at my Trial <hi>ſubpoena'd,</hi> could have mentioned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with relation to his (then) High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Guilt in this matter; but I found it was a Truth too hot, which that Court would not hear, and therefore thought it not proper to call them, but left them till ſuch a Seaſon wherein <hi>Truth</hi> in this matter ſhould not be proſecuted as the higheſt <hi>Offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thls brings me to the Proofs that have in this Caſe been taken before the late Right Honourable Committee of Lords. But before I do begin with the Evidence, it may not be amiſs to give ſome ſhort Account how this Caſe came before that Right Honourable Houſe, where it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally brought, upon the motion of the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> then Governour of the <hi>Tower.</hi>

            <p>For the day before the Convention ſate, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>February</hi> 1688. having a Warrant againſt ſeveral as ſuſpected privy to, or concerned in the Murther of this Honourable Patriot; and amongſt the reſt, againſt Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> at whoſe Houſe my Lord was murdered, and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the Warder before-mentioned; both which belonged to the <hi>Tower:</hi> I deſired a Friend of mine to acquaint the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Governour therewith, ſo that theſe perſons might be ſecured. As ſoon as the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> ſaw the Warrant againſt theſe two, he did order them both to be be ſecured; and the next day there was ſeveral Depoſitions, with relation to my Lord's Murther, taken before Juſtice <hi>Robins,</hi> who that very day carried Copies of them to my Lord <hi>Lucas;</hi> upon which, his Lordſhip the very next day moved the Houſe of Lords for their Lordſhips directions as to the diſpoſal of <hi>Hawley</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and thereupon produced theſe Informations Mr. <hi>Robins</hi> had before brought him. Upon reading of theſe, the Houſe entred into a debate of the matter, and then called me before their Lordſhips, before whom I gave a ſhort Account of what is as before moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially mentioned. After which, their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56409:16"/> Lordſhips conſtituted a more general Committee.</p>
            <p>This Committee having ſeveral times met, there was a cloſe Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; the Order for which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>

            <p>Several other Perſons were now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before their Lordſhips, who having finiſhed their Examinations, they began to reduce thoſe Depoſitions and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into ſuch order, as to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhould ſeem moſt meet, but this was hardly finiſhed before the 27th Day of <hi>January,</hi> when the laſt Parliament was prorogued, and the 6th of <hi>February</hi> diſſolved, and conſequently all Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings hereupon ſtopt till their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhall think fit to revive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee in order to bring in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before the Honourable Lords of the late Committee, and ſome Juſtices of the Peace, I ſhall, in as ſhort an Abſtract as I can well reduce it, here give you; in which I ſhall obſerve, for the moſt part, as it falls in order of time; and <hi>firſt,</hi> what paſſed before my Lord's Murther; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the day of his Death; <hi>thirdly,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of his Death.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> before my Lord's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is depoſed by <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> to this effect: <q>That about nine days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord's Death, being Servant with one <hi>Holmes</hi> in <hi>Baldwins-Gardens,</hi> and ſtanding upon the Kitchen-ſtairs, ſhe heard ſeveral Papiſts diſcourſing (in the Parlour of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe) concerning the taking off the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and it was then and there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That they had been with His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and His Highneſs was firſt for poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning the ſaid Earl; but that manner of Death being objected againſt, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to His Highneſs, That the Earl ſhould be ſtabbed; but this manner likewiſe not being thought proper, His Highneſs had concluded and ordered his Throat to be cut; and His Highneſs had promiſed to be there when it was done.</hi> About three days after this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> about ſix days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earl's Death, ſome of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid perſons met again at her ſaid Maſter's Houſe, where ſhe heard them declare to this effect, <hi>That they had reſolved the Earl's Throat ſhould be cut; but they would give it out, That he had done it himſelf; and if any ſhould deny it, they would take them up, and puniſh them for it.</hi> This Informant being hereupon much troubled in her mind, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to prevent (if poſſible) this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Miſchief, did hereupon adviſe with one Mr. <hi>Billinger,</hi> who before that time had been her Maſter; but the ſaid Mr. <hi>Billinger</hi> told her to this effect: That if ſhe valued her life, ſhe ſhould not diſcover it to any; for the Papiſts then carrying all before them, ſhe was ruined if ſhe did. Wherefore ſhe did not before my Lord's Death (to her remembrance) diſcover it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs ſhe might to Mrs. <hi>Billin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> in which ſhe can't be poſitive: But the day of my Lord's Death, about Two or Three of the Clock the ſame day, ſome of the aforeſaid Conſult co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to her ſaid Maſter <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56409:17"/> one leap'd about the Room as extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-joy'd, and ſtrikes the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> on the back, and cried, <hi>The Feat was done,</hi> or <hi>we have done the Feat;</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>He could not but laugh, to think how like a Fool the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>look'd when they came to cut his Throat.</hi>
               </q> She further ſaith, <q>That about five years ſince, living with Mr. <hi>Rowdon</hi> of the <hi>Old-Exchange,</hi> ſhe was willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what ſhe had as before heard, to her ſaid Maſter and Miſtreſs, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but her ſaid Maſter <hi>Rowden</hi> was not free to hear all ſhe could ſay with relation hereunto, but adviſed her to hold her peace; for by ſuch her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhe might ruine. Him and all his Family.</q> This is further confirmed by the Oaths of Mr. <hi>Rowden,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mary Rowden:</hi> And Mrs. <hi>Rowden</hi> doth further depoſe to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <q>That the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> hath ſome years ſince with great concern declared, That ſhe did hope to live to ſee the day wherein ſhe might fully teſtifie her knowledge herein; and this ſhe would do, when ſhe might without danger.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and his Wife have depoſed to this effect: <q>That <hi>November</hi> laſt was two years, this <hi>Dorothy</hi> lived with them as their Servant; and in tears hath often declared her over-hearing the Papiſts conſult of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murther ſeveral days before his Death, and by whoſe Order the Earl was to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: But theſe Informants knowing the danger of ſuch diſcourſe (the late King <hi>James</hi> being then in ſo great Power) did adviſe her, for her own Safety, and the Safety of thoſe ſhe lived with, not thus to diſcourſe: But the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> in tears did uſually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it lay upon her mind night and day; and ſhe could not be quiet in her thoughts, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould be falſly charged with cutting his own Throat, when ſhe had heard the Papiſts reſolution to cut it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and after own they <hi>had</hi> done it. And if ever ſhe might with ſafety teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Truth herein, ſhe would; and did hope thoſe Men that did it, might ſuffer for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard May</hi> depoſeth to this effect <q>That (to the beſt of this Informant's remembrance) before the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, obſerving <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothy Smith</hi> to be very melancholy, he deſired to know the cauſe; upon which ſhe ſaid, <hi>That ſomewhat which ſhe knew with relation to the Death of the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>was the cauſe of her trouble; and it was not ſafe for her to reveal it to any.</hi> Upon which, this Informant adviſed her then to be ſilent in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But about the beginning of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> after our now King's coming, finding it ſafe for the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> herein to declare her knowledge, this Informant went to the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> and told her, She might now ſafely ſpeak what ſhe knew as to my Lord's Death; upon which, the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> told this Informant, How ſhe had heard the Papiſts ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days before my Lord's Death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare How the Earl's Throat was to be cut, and by Whom ordered, (with ſeveral particulars in relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto); upon which, this Informant diſcovered this to Mr. <hi>William Tornay,</hi> who thereupon told this Informant he would reveal this to Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> then upon the Proſecution of my Lord's Murther; and ſome ſhort time after, Mr. <hi>Tornay</hi> told this Informant, That he had therewith acquainted Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and deſired this Informant, with the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> to meet the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Tornay,</hi> ſuch a time, at the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> in <hi>Watlin-ſtreet,</hi> where they met accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: But when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56409:18"/> been particularly informed herein by the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> declared, That unleſs the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> could make it appear, That ſhe had long ſince revealed this, he would eſteem it as a new-made Story, and a Lye. Upon which, the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> mentioned the Names of ſeveral to whom ſhe declared ſhe had long ſince revealed it; but by all was enjoined to Secrecy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>William Tourney</hi> hath likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed what herein relates to him. And I am ready to depoſe, That I never heard of this <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Tourney</hi> about <hi>February</hi> laſt was Twelve Month, informed me of her; and I never to my remembrance, ſaw the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> till the ſaid Mr. <hi>May</hi> had, as before, brought her to the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> in <hi>Watlinſtreet,</hi> where I firſt diſcourſed her in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. <hi>May,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tourney,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here are five or ſix Witneſſes prove the very Subſtance of this Evidence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſome years ſince, when it was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs then Death to diſcourſe it, which clearly proves it is not a new-made Story, and ſtrongly argues the truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for it can hardly be ſuppoſed, that this Woman ſhould often under the greateſt Concern and Danger imaginable, declare any thing of this nature, unleſs the Relation was really true; Becauſe ſhe could (rationally) then propoſe no Advantage by this Invention; but was ſtill told, and convinced of the Danger. Wherefore 'tis rational to ſuppoſe, that only the power of Truth moved her to declare what ſhe ſo often in Tears related. But as a further Argument of the truth of this Depoſition, I ſhall briefly relate what Informations have been taken in Contradiction to this Relation, and how theſe Informations have been detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as falſe in every particular, which corroborates the Truth of the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>For as a true Defence detects and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates a falſe Charge; ſo a falſe Defence (being diſcovered to be ſuch) as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthens a true one.</hi> The Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in oppoſition to <hi>Smith</hi>'s Evidence, were,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorothy Hewits</hi> a moſt violent Papiſt, who the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolben</hi> depoſed, <q>That in <hi>April</hi> before my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death, the ſaid <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> was turned away from Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s, upon Suſpicion of having ſtoln a Silver Spoon; and that from <hi>April</hi> 1683. to nine Months next after, one <hi>Elizabeth Chriſtopher,</hi> then <hi>Elizabeth Cadman,</hi> was Servant to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> and no other Maid-ſervant in all that mean time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Chriſtophers</hi> (of a very looſe Character) who in this particular upon Oath, the 9th day of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolben,</hi> confirms <hi>Hewit</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; but that theſe two are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn, appears by many Depoſitions. For,</p>
            <p>It's proved by <hi>Robert Bond,</hi> that <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> did not go to Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Service, till the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 1683. and that Green Beans were fit to be eat, before ſhe left that Service in which ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, juſt before ſhe went to <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
            <p>It's further proved by five Witneſſes,<note place="margin">Elizabeth Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Ann Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, Katherine Coldham, Sarah Douthwait, <hi>and</hi> Robert Bond.</note> That <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothy Smith</hi> was Servant at this <hi>Holme</hi>'s, when Green-peaſe were very plenty and cheap (which is naturally evident it muſt be in the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> or ſometime in <hi>July,</hi> which is about two Months after <hi>Hewit</hi> ſwore <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> was turned away; and it's poſitively ſworn by one, that <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi> was Servant in <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>July</hi> 1683. after the Death of the late Earl <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and this Informant remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56409:18"/> the time, by a very remarkable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. So that here are five or ſix De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in Contradiction to <hi>Hewit</hi>'s and <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s Evidence, which was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy the Credit of <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi>'s Teſtimony; but this Oppoſition thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, adds ſtrength to what it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to prejudice. But it was further ſworn by <hi>Hewit,</hi> that the 6th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. (which was the <hi>Friday</hi> in the Week before my Lord's Death) ſhe went with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> into the Countrey, and the firſt Night lay at <hi>Wickham</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> the next Night at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and continued there till the 9th; and the 9th, this Informant went with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> to <hi>Alderminſter</hi> in the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Nathanael Swan,</hi> Miniſter of the ſaid Town, and continued there till the 23d of the ſaid Month of <hi>July,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nathanael Swan</hi> Clerk, depoſeth before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolben</hi> the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. <q>That <hi>about</hi> the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. <hi>Hewit</hi> and <hi>Holmes</hi> came to his Houſe in <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and continued there till <hi>about</hi> the 23d.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt Information is of little force (tho the Parſon deſigned well) for it ſwears, <hi>about</hi> ſuch a time <hi>Holmes</hi> came to his Houſe, and <hi>about</hi> ſuch a time went away; but <hi>about</hi> makes the time very uncertain.</p>
            <p>This was deſigned to deſtroy that part of <hi>Dorothy Smith</hi>'s Teſtimony, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>Holmes</hi> in Town, the day my Lord was murthered.</p>
            <p>When I found Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> endeavoured to prove (as before ſworn by <hi>Hewit</hi>) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of Town, from the 6th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. to the 26th or 27th of the ſame Month; I did endeavour to enquire out all ſuch, as either Mr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> or Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> were well-known to, or traded with; and therefore I made inquiry after thoſe, with whom (in that Month and Year) they Bought of, or Sold to, all Shopkeepers, Taylors, Butchers, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Shoemakers, Hatters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch as upon inquiry, I received ſuch Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of, as I might expect fair Satisfaction from, I did deſire to ſee their Books in that Month of <hi>July,</hi> to ſee whether any Goods were bought in Town by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> or Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> (for proving <hi>Hewit</hi> in Town, proves <hi>Holmes</hi> likewiſe in Town, becauſe it's ſworn, and can be proved, they both went out of Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) or any Money paid between the 6th and 26th of <hi>July,</hi> by either of theſe. After a very long and tedious Inquiry (all thoſe Tradeſmen being altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to me) I providentially met with one Mr. <hi>Welſtead,</hi> who very readily ſhewed his Book, wherein is entred according to his Information, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Welſtead</hi> of St <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the <hi>Weſt, London,</hi> declareth, and is ready to depoſe, <q>That in <hi>July</hi> 1683. he liv'd in <hi>Poppins Alley,</hi> nigh <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> very near Mrs. <hi>Dorothy Hewit,</hi> and often wrought for the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Hewit;</hi> and between <hi>Monday</hi> the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 16th day of the ſame Month and Year, this Informant made, or cauſed to be made a Duſt-gown for the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Hewit,</hi> as appears by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formants Book, ready to be produced; and the very ſame Week, <hi>(viz.)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Monday</hi> the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. and <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th of the ſame Month and Year, (but in the very day this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant is not certain); this Informant carried the ſaid Gown to the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Hewit,</hi> who did then pretend ſhe was about going into the Country; but how long after the Duſt-gown ſo delivered, the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> did go into the Country, this Informant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Book hath not been of any uſe to Mr. <hi>Welſtead</hi> for almoſt five Years, and it was a very great Providence this had not been torn out, ſeeing the Book for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56409:19"/> ſome years had been uſed as waſt Paper, and the very next leaf to this torn out, and loſt. As ſoon as Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> underſtood ſuch a Taylor's Entry was againſt her Oath, ſhe, with Mrs. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Wife, went to this Taylor, and deſired to ſee his Book; which being ſhew'd, <hi>Hewit</hi> firſt pretended that this Entry was forged, and new; but Mr. <hi>Welſtead</hi> declared he could ſafely, and would depoſe, "That the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was real; it was then pretended, that the Gown was ſent into the Countrey af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mrs. <hi>Hewit;</hi> but when in anſwer to that, Mr. <hi>Welſtead</hi> declared he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, "That Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> was in Town when that Duſt-gown was made and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and that ſhe then pretended ſhe was about going into the Countrey, (but how many days after ſhe did go, he could not tell). Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> told him, if he did ſwear that, he would take off her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life, and <hi>Holmes.</hi>s Blood would be upon his head.</p>
            <p>Some time after my Lord's Murther, this <hi>Holmes</hi> abuſing his Wife, ſhe told him, <hi>He was a murtherous Rogue, and he well knew ſhe could hang him when ſhe pleas'd.</hi> To which <hi>Holmes</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he little thought ſhe would have ſpoken of it, who of all the World had the leaſt reaſon:</hi> For, ſaid this ſcurrilous Fellow, <hi>You Bitch, you Whore, Don't you remember I bought you a good Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Gown and Petticoat, and therefore you above all the World ought not to prate.</hi> But ſhe replied, <hi>He was a murtherous Rogue for all that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the more large and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in this Evidence, as well becauſe it hath met with ſuch villanous Oppoſition by falſe Oaths, as for that it alone proves by what Party, and by whoſe Order this Unfortunate Lord was treacherouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
            <p>The next thing previous to my Lord's Murther, are the ſeveral Reports in many places in <hi>England</hi> (before my Lord's death, or before it could be known) that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower.</hi> This is proved by Eight Witneſſes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Hubland, <hi>Merch. Mrs.</hi> Hubland. <hi>Mrs.</hi> Meux. Treherne. Jeremiah Burgis. Thomas Feilder. — Savage. <hi>Mr.</hi> Butler.</note> It is as to this ſworn, <q>That at <hi>Frome</hi>
               </q> (which is about 100 Miles from <hi>London</hi>) <q>it was reported the very next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Lord's Commitment to the <hi>Tower (viz.)</hi> the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower:</hi>
               </q> And this Informant, the week after my Lord's death, meeting the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman which had before given him this Information, and deſiring to know how before my Lord's death he could declare it; the other replied, That all men concluded my Lord would either cut his Throat, or turn Evidence againſt his Friend my Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> but it was generally believed that my Lord would rather deſtroy himſelf, than be made a Witneſs.</p>
            <p>This Report ſo far off the very next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after my Lord's Commitment, proves the <hi>Tower</hi> to be the place (before my Lord's Commitment) pitched upon as the moſt proper for this perfidious Tragedy.</p>
            <p>But the very next day <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> after my Lord's Commitment, was it reported about 60 miles off, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower</hi> for this reaſon <hi>(viz.) The King and Duke coming into the</hi> Tower <hi>to view the</hi> Tower, <hi>the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was afraid the King would have come up into his Chamber, and ſeen him; but his Guilt and Shame was ſuch, that he could not bear the thoughts of it, and therefore cut his Throat to avoid it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve in this previous Report ſixty miles from <hi>London,</hi> the next day after my Lord's Commitment, the very pretended Reaſon for the Self-murther is given; which Reaſon carries in it an accident that could never be before reported, or indeed expected, but by thoſe which were the moſt ſecret in this Treacherous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; for herein is it ſaid, the <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56409:19"/> before the King and Duke went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> that the King and Duke were in the <hi>Tower</hi> when the Earl cut his Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is notorious that the King and Duke did not go till <hi>Friday</hi> morning, and their then going was a ſurprize to their very Guards, for it ſeems they had not been there together above once ſince the Reſtauration. In ſhort, Theſe ſeveral Reports proved by Eight Witneſſes, all agree in the <hi>manner how,</hi> and <hi>place where;</hi> and one more particularly ſets forth <hi>the pretended Reaſon wherefore.</hi> I do therefore humbly ſubmit to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, whether theſe very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports do not ſtrongly prove, <hi>that the manner, place, and pretended reaſon,</hi> were all agreed upon before this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous complicated Tragedy was acted. For otherwiſe, how could it poſſibly be ſo particularly related ſo far off, and ſo long before it was done?</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the 2d place obſerve what paſſed in the day of my Lord's murther, which proves his death to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> before-mention'd, did before the Coroner's Jury upon Oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that any men were let into my Lord that morning my Lord died. The like did <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> the Soldier that kept the outward Door, depoſe at my Trial, <hi>pag.</hi> 57.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nathanael Monday,</hi> who was my Lord's other Warder, and likewiſe <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> before the Lords have denied that any men were that morning let into my Lord. But that there were ſome Ruffians a little before my Lord's death let in to murther him, plainly appears by the Proofs following.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Story</hi> depoſeth to the effect following. <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <q>The 21ſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. being the day before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſat, <hi>John Lloyd</hi> (Sentinel upon the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at the time of his death) was taken up as ſuſpected privy to the ſaid Earl's murther; and being therefore in cuſtody, the ſaid <hi>Lloyd,</hi> with tears in his Eyes, wrung this Informant by the hand, and declared, That by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Order of Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> or one of my Lord's Warders, he did let in two or three men into the Earl's Lodgings juſt before his death, and he was very ſure, and could ſafely ſwear that Major <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> (then there in cuſtody, ſuſpected as one of the Ruffians that murthered my Lord) was one; and that as ſoon as he ſo let them in, he heard a noiſe in my Lord's Chamber, and ſomewhat thrown down like the fall of a man; ſoon after which it was ſaid, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Lloyd</hi> the ſame day before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did confeſs the letting in ſome men a little before the Earl's death, as appears by his Examination following.</p>
            <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="examination">
               <body>
                  <head>The Examination of <hi>John Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Goodman's-Yard</hi> in <hi>Aldgate</hi> Pariſh without, in <hi>London,</hi> Clothworker, taken before <hi>John Robins,</hi> Eſq one of the Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> the 22d day of <hi>January,</hi> 1689.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THis Examinant ſaith, on the day whereon the Right Honourable the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was found dead upon the ſuſpicion of having been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in his Lodgings in the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London; <hi>he then being a Soldier, was ſtanding Sentinel at the door of the ſaid Earl's Lodgings, and had order to let no body up ſtairs to the ſaid Lodgings without leave from Major</hi> Hawley, <hi>or the Warder then in waiting on the ſaid Earl; and that about half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eight of the Clock in the Morning of the ſaid day, two Men (to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant unknown) knocked at the hatch-door
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56409:20"/> belonging to the ſaid Lodgings, and by permiſſion of the ſaid Warder, entred the ſaid Lodgings; but when they came out, he can give no account; and that about Nine a Clock he heard a ſtruggling on the ſaid Morning, and a little time after heard a Crying,</hi> My Lord is dead.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>After <hi>Lloyd</hi> had lain ſome time cloſe Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> he did deſire to ſee one Mr. <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> a Neighbour of his, who having permiſſion of the Secret Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to diſcourſe <hi>Lloyd,</hi> thereupon went to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he found the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> very melancholly; when Mr. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> firſt came, <hi>Lloyd</hi> told him, that he did hope, as he was his Neighbour, he would be his Friend, <hi>and true to him;</hi> to which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwered, that he would, if the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> was ingenuous in his Diſcovery; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> (after often preſſing the ſaid Mr. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> to be true to him) told him, that when he was firſt ſeiſed, he did confeſs to a Gentleman, who was altogether a ſtranger to him, the letting in ſome men into my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> juſt before his death; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion did lie upon his Conſcience, and troubled him night and day; upon which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> replied, That the like he had confeſſed to ſeveral the ſame day he was taken; and he declared the ſame before a Juſtice of Peace; but if it was falſe, he ought to retract it, and be ſorry for having ſaid it; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> renewing his Requeſt, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> would be true to him, <hi>ſaid, it was indeed</hi> very true, but it was what he <hi>ſhould not have confeſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lloyd</hi> did then farther declare, <q>That upon the letting in thoſe Men, there was ſo great a buſtle in my Lord's Chamber, that the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> would have forced in after them, but the Warder had made faſt the outward door, ſo that he could not; and that upon the buſtle he did hear ſomewhat thrown down like the fall of a Man, which he did ſuppoſe was my Lord's Body; and ſoon after, it was cry'd out that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</q> This is the ſubſtance of what Mr. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> hath depoſed before the Lords.</p>
            <p>By this it appears more than probable, not only that my Lord was murthered, but that there was ſome villanous Oath of Secrecy entred into by thoſe concern'd therein, not to diſcover what they knew with relation thereunto; for what other as likely reaſon can be aſſigned for <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s being troubled in Conſcience (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) for having confeſſed what at the ſame time under repeated injunctions of ſecrecy, he confirmed to be true, though he ſaid he ſhould not have confeſſed it?</p>
            <p>But to put this matter beyond all doubt, that ſome men were buſtling with his Lordſhip juſt before his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Self-murther diſcover'd, evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this Information following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha Baſcomb</hi> declareth, and before the Lords in ſubſtance hath depos'd, <q>That a little before the death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was diſcovered, this Informant was walking up before the Earl's Chamber-window, and hearing a very great trampling and buſtle in my Lord's Chamber, this Informant ſtood ſtill, and looking to the Window of the ſaid Chamber, ſaw three or four Heads move cloſe together, and heard one in the Chamber (which ſeemed to be one in this buſtle) cry out very loud, and very dolefully, <hi>Murther, murther, murther;</hi> this Informant not then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be my Lord's Lodging, nor thinking any other of this Cry, than what might be occaſioned by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental quarrel, walked up towards
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56409:20"/> the Chappel, but not out of ſight of the Lodgings, and about a quarter of an hour after (or leſs) it was firſt cryed out in the Houſe, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat; upon which this Informant went down to the Houſe, and being ſhewed the Chamber where the Earl lay, ſhe found that was the Chamber where ſhe ſaw the men, and heard the buſtle, and Murther cried out, as before related.</q> This Informant further ſaith, <q>That ſome few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, telling Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and his Wife (whom ſhe then kept in her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in) of what ſhe had ſeen and heard, as before declared; the ſaid Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> adviſed her not to ſpeak of it, for her divulging it, in all probability would prove her ruine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath upon Oath confirmed the latter part of <hi>Martha Baſcomb</hi>'s Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which clearly proves this not a newly-invented Story.</p>
            <p>I think this proof is little leſs than oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Evidence of the Murther; for my Lord was a cloſe Priſoner, to whom (as was pretended, and ſworn by ſuch as kept the Chamber-door) none was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Morning; but his Lordſhip cut his Throat in all ſilence; whereas it is here depoſed, that ſeveral were buſtling together in my Lord's Chamber before his death (and this part agrees with the Confeſſion of the Sentinel who let in the Ruffins) and one in this buſtle (which can be preſumed to be no other than my Lord) cry'd out ſeveral times very loud, and very dolefully, <hi>Murther, Murther, Murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a farther Confirmation of theſe Men being (and by whom) ſent to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Lord, <hi>Elizabeth Gladwin</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Hughes</hi> declare, (and before the Lords in ſubſtance have depoſed) <q>That the day of the death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, (viz.)</hi> the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. about Eleven of the Clock the ſame day, one <hi>Ruddle,</hi> in the hearing of theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants, did declare, That he was in the <hi>Tower</hi> that morning, where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat, but he was ſure he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that by the Order of his ROYAL HIGHNESS; for the ſaid <hi>Ruddle</hi> then declared, That he did obſerve His Majeſty and Royal Highneſs part a little from thoſe that attended them, and diſcourſed (to the beſt of theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants remembrance); The ſaid <hi>Ruddle</hi> declared it was in <hi>French,</hi> concerning the Priſoners then in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and his HIGHNESS declared, That of all the Priſoners then there, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ought to be taken off; but His Majeſty ſaid he was reſolved to ſpare him for what his Father had ſuffered; upon which his HIGHNESS ſeemed very diſſatisfied; and a little before the death of the ſaid Earl, his HIGHNESS parted a little way from His Majeſty, and then two men were ſent into the Earl's Lodgings to murther him.</q> —So far before their Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Ruddle</hi> declared this with great earneſtneſs and paſſion, and proteſted he thought no man ſafe who was againſt the Popiſh Intereſt, if once they began thus bare-faced to cut Throats. And he proteſted his blood did ſo boil aginſt his Royal Highneſs, that if he could have got a Party that would have ſtood by him, he would have ſhot his Highneſs dead upon the ſpot, for ſo bare-fac'd a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had before ſcarce ever been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under a Civil Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Bampton</hi> and his Wife both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and in ſubſtance before the Lords have depoſed, <q>That about one of the Clock, the very day the late Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> died in the <hi>Tower,</hi> one <hi>Robert Meak</hi> that morning (a Soldier in the <hi>Tower</hi>) came to theſe Informants Houſe, and theſe Informants deſired the ſaid <hi>Meake</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56409:21"/> to give them the beſt account he could how the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his own Throat; to which the ſaid <hi>Meake</hi> (with ſome earneſtneſs and paſſion) anſwered, That the ſaid Earl did not cut his own Throat, but was barbarouſly murthered by two men ſent for that purpoſe by his ROYAL HIGHNESS to the Earls Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings juſt before his death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Ro. Meake</hi> did further declare, and what was ſince his fate, you will hear in its proper order.</p>
            <p>I do expect it will be objected, That theſe four are but hearſay Evidence. To which I ſhall anſwer almoſt in the very words of a late Diſcourſe on this Subject, <hi>(viz.) Seeing there is reaſon to believe that the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling the firſt murther occaſioned the addition of theſe two Soldiers blood (as you will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have ſome grounds to uppoſe) I think ſuch Informations ought not to be ſlighted; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that rate it's but taking off ſuch as knew any thing with relation to a murther, and you are very ſecure from any diſcovery, though never ſo many upon Oath give an account of what thoſe men (whoſe mouths have been by murther ſtopt from giving their own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) have declared in the mattor.</hi> Theſe two Soldiers related the ſame as to the ſending the Men into my Lord's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in two Houſes as far diſtant as <hi>Dukeſ-place</hi> and <hi>Baldwin's-Gardens;</hi> and I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſuaded that neither <hi>Hughes</hi> nor <hi>Gladwin</hi> ever ſpoke to <hi>Bampton</hi> and his Wife in their lives, for neither two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen or heard of the other Informants. And who could imagine that two Soldiers ſhould declare with ſuch concern and earneſtneſs that which was ſo very dangerous to be ſpoken, if their love to truth, and hatred of ſuch a treacherous and bloody Murther had not even forced it from them, to the hazard of almoſt their lives by ſuch their Relation?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, no man ought to ſuffer bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon hear-ſay Evidence, but ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony hath been uſed to corroborate what elſe may be ſworn, and of it ſelf may (in ſome caſes) be enough to give ſatisfaction in the general of the truth of a matter, and no farther is it here us'd: and I would have all men conſider the many ſuch Teſtimonies heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, amongſt which I ſhall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one which had an immediate relation to my ſelf. Mr <hi>Blaithwaite</hi> (Clerk of the Council in 1683. and as I think ſtill in that poſt) at my Trial, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. being ſworn on the behalf of the King, againſt Mr. <hi>Speake</hi> and my ſelf, in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what the Young <hi>Edward</hi>'s Siſter ſhould declare to the Council-Board <hi>(viz.) That</hi> Braddon <hi>compelled the Boy to ſign it,</hi> (the Paper the young <hi>Edwards</hi> ſigned). This you find to be <hi>Hear-ſay-Evidence,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> (the Siſter) then in Court, but teſtified no ſuch thing; therefore this <hi>Hear-ſay-Evidence</hi> ought (if any ought) to have been rejected: and yet this <hi>Hear-ſay-Evidence</hi> (though not confirmed by the Author then upon Oath) was not only admitted, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be Printed in the Trial in large Capital Letters. How much ſooner ought the Evidence of <hi>Bampton</hi> and his Wife (as to what <hi>Meake</hi> declared), and of <hi>Hughes</hi> and <hi>Gladwin,</hi> as to <hi>Ruddle</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, be particularly remarked, ſeeing <hi>Meake</hi> and <hi>Ruddle</hi> we cannot now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in Court, (as that Author was), they (eſpecially the firſt) being ſuppoſed to be murdered by way of prevention, by that bloody Party that murdered my Lord.</p>
            <p>But the next Account of theſe two Men being ſent, as before, by His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall be from the firſt hand. Mr. <hi>Peter Eſſington</hi> declareth, (and before the Lords in ſubſtance hath depoſed), <q>That he this Informant was in the <hi>Tower</hi> that morning the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died; and about a quarter of an hour before the ſaid Earl's Death was diſcovered, this Informant obſerved His Highneſs to part a little way from His Majeſty,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56409:21"/> and then beck'ned to two Gentlemen to come to him, who came according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and this Informant did obſerve His Highneſs to ſend them towards the Earl's Lodgings; and leſs than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after, this Informant did obſerve theſe very two Men to return to his Highneſs, and as they came they ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and (to the beſt of this Informant's hearing and remembrance) ſaid, <hi>The buſineſs is done;</hi> upon which, His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeem'd very well pleaſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon His Highneſs went to His Majeſty; ſoon after which, News was brought to the King, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>had cut his Throat.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I do expect that will be objected to this, which heretofore hath been, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it cannot be thought the late Duke of <hi>York</hi> (admit he was ſo bad as to give Order for ſuch a Fact) would be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick as to ſend the <hi>Ruffians,</hi> ſo that any People might ſee their Miſſion and their Return. But I deſire ſuch would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Murther in all its Circumſtances, and then tell me, Whether thoſe bloody Varlets had not all the reaſon in the world to have all the Security could be expected or deſired? You well know, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was deſervedly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Popular; and therefore a Parliament that ſhould have had the leaſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this treacherous and bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would have proſecuted the matter with all the diligence and vigour ſuch a piece of barbarity deſerved. Now, ſhould they, in ſuch their Inquiſitions, have detected thoſe treacherous Villains, theſe bloody Men without a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery muſt have expected no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and ſhould the Duke have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd them in his Cloſet only, and they could not by any Circumſtance have given ſatisfaction that they were his hired Journey-men in this piece of great Service, their Evidence againſt him had not been the tenth part ſo credible as it would have been, could they have proved that they were ſent by His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the Earl's Lodgings juſt before his Death, and ſoon after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to His Highneſs, before others knew that this cruel Tragedy was finiſhed. This Circumſtance, I ſay, would have ſo corroborated their Evidence againſt their Maſter, that none could in the leaſt have doubted of the truth of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo employed, that were once ſatisfied they were, as before, ſent by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to His Highneſs. This then obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Highneſs, under no leſs obligation than Self-preſervation, to skreen thoſe his faithful and ready Servants from any Proſecution, well knowing that his own Intereſt (and indeed Life) was wrapt up in theirs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I think this matter was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunningly managed (as to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Cut-throats from the hands of Juſtice, either in their Puniſhments or Proſecution). And it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have been done with greater Safety to the perſons of thoſe that did it.</p>
            <p>The Centinel <hi>Lloyd</hi> declared, He could not be poſitive whether Major <hi>Hawley</hi> or the Warder let the men into the outward door: But Major <hi>Hawley</hi> pretends, He could not; for he (as he ſaith) went out of his Houſe at Five a Clock in the morning, and did not go nigh his own Houſe till News of my Lord's Death was brought him by <hi>Monday</hi> the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and therefore he could not open the door to any that went in juſt before my Lord's Death. This reaſon of Major <hi>Hawley</hi> is equally true with what elſe he ſaith in his Defence, as appears by this Information.</p>

            <p>But it ſeems Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Principles were ever averſe to thoſe brave True <hi>Engliſh</hi> Champions that oppoſed the late Court-Arbitrary-deſigns, and could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thoſe Honourable Lords, and Truly-worthy Knights and Gentlemen, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Titles than <hi>Rogues.</hi> This appears by what he declared the very day that a great number of Honourable Lords (amongſt which, this unfortunate Lord, I hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was one) and Worthy Knights, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Citizens, dined together at <hi>Mile-end-Green;</hi> for ſome time that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon <hi>Hawley</hi> told Mr. <hi>Bunch,</hi> then a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That above Two hundred Rogues that day dined together at <hi>Mile-end-Green;</hi> but he did wiſh that he had Forty of the biggeſt of them there in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that they might be made ſhorter by the Head; for till then the Land would never be at quiet. This in ſubſtance is depoſed by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bunch,</hi> who with one Mr.— are ready likewiſe to depoſe, That ſome time ſince diſcourſing with one — a Servant-maid in the <hi>Tower</hi> at the time of my Lord's Murther, but ſince turned out, they told her, That it was ſuppoſed to be Major <hi>Hawley</hi> that occaſioned her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned out of the <hi>Tower;</hi> but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>It could not be the Major, for he was the beſt Friend ſhe had in the world, upon the account of ſomewhat which ſhe knew with relation to the Death of the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex.</p>
            <p>I have ſome grounds to believe, that not a few in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that morning my Lord was murdered, could diſcover ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things very material in order to a farther detection; and particularly, as to the coming out of the Ruffians after they had perpetrated this not to-be-paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd treacherous Cruelty; for I have been informed by ſome, who that very morning my Lord was murdered were in <hi>Leaden-hall-Market,</hi> That there came a Servant-maid (who then lived, as ſhe ſaid, in the <hi>Tower</hi>) to that Market the very ſame morning; and wringing her hands, ſhe wept, and cried out, <hi>The Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was murdered;</hi> upon which, the People gathering about her, adviſed her to ſilence, telling her ſhe would bring her ſelf into trouble by ſuch expreſſions; the Maid thereupon declared, <hi>She was ſure it was true, for ſhe ſaw the Men that murdered him, juſt as they came from his Lodgings.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56409:23"/>
            <p>I have uſed all diligence poſſible to find this Maid out; but neither of thoſe I have met with could tell me her Name, or the Name of the perſon in the <hi>Tower</hi> with whom ſhe lived. Not long after my Lord's Death, I was likewiſe inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Name of one who declared he ſaw the Ruffians juſt as they came out of my Lord's Lodgings, and did obſerve ſome Blood upon the Cloaths of one of them: But having been obliged in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to convey away my Papers, this Name I have loſt. I do wiſh I could find men as free, as their Duty obliges them in this matter, to declare what they knew.</p>
            <p>I have reaſon to ſuppoſe many men would be then examined; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is that can diſcover any thing material with relation to this Murther, and in ſilence ſtifles it, by ſuch his ſilence he conſents to the Blood of my Lord: and though our Law may not reach his Offence, yet he who knows it, will one day lay it to his Charge; for if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that all Governments ſhould make diligent Inquiſition for Blood, in defect whereof he will require the Blood of the Slain at the hands of ſuch Magiſtrates on whom this neglect is chargeable; then on thoſe more eſpecially will the greateſt guilt lie, who refuſe or neglect to give Information to thoſe ordained for ſuch Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>But, to return:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> you find, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depoſed, That there was a Razor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to my Lord, wherewith to pare his Nails; which his Lordſhip having done, he retired into his Cloſet, and there cut his Throat. The Cloſet-door being opened, <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> have declared they ſaw the Body there lie in its Blood, and the Razor lying by him.</p>
            <p>This is, in ſhort, the ſubſtance of theſe Mens Relations, whoſe Intereſt it is to prove the Self-murther. That this Story is falſe in every part, I doubt not but to convince every unprejudic'd perſon, and hope to ſatisfie all who are not blinded with prejudice,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That his Lordſhip did not pare his Nails that morning he died, as all theſe have ſworn or declared; nor was there any Razor delivered to my Lord for that purpoſe that morning he died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That his Lordſhip's Body was not locked into the Cloſet, when firſt found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there was no Razor ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Body when theſe three firſt ſaw the Body; but the Razor laid there after my Lord was murdered, to colour the pretended Self-murther.</p>
            <p>That my Lord's Nails were not par'd, <hi>John Kittlebeater</hi> hath depoſed, That he being one of the Coroner's Jury, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrowly obſerve my Lord's Nails on his Fingers and Feet, and could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern either of them par'd or ſcrap'd.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now prove <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Relation to be falſe, by what <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſwore; and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Depoſition forged by what <hi>Monday</hi> declared the very day, and ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Lord was murdered; and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>'s Account in every material part a fiction, by the Depoſitions of the two former: In order to which, I ſhall give you <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s firſt Information, taken in the Coroner's own hand, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Informant further ſaith, <q>That the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> did then declare, That he tarried with my Lord in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber two hours or better that very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and that whilſt he was with my Lord in his Chamber, he did obſerve his Lordſhip pared his Nails with the Heel of a Razor.

This Informant further ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> did further declare, That when he came up ſtairs, he asked Mr. <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Where they were whilſt my Lord was in the Cloſet?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Jordan</hi> declareth, <q>That on the day Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was tried, in <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>-Term, 1683. (upon the account of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) this Informant heard <hi>Nathanael Monday</hi> declare, That the very morning the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died, as ſoon as the Gentleman-Gaoler opened the Chamber-door, which was about Seven of the Clock, the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> ſtood as Warder above-ſtairs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Earl; and at the firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door, did obſerve the ſaid Earl to have a Razor in his hand, paring or ſcraping his Nails with it; and this the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> declared he ſaw a long time before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood Warder above ſtairs upon the ſaid Earl.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe two Informations, you may perceive what <hi>Monday</hi> declared; <hi>My Lord had this Razor in his hand about Seven a Clock in the morning, long before</hi> Ruſſel <hi>came up ſtairs to ſtand Warder upon my Lord; and that my Lord pared his Nails with the Heel of the Razor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, I cannot but here take notice of what <hi>Monday</hi> would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Government was jealous my Lord would deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for otherwiſe, how ſhould there be Orders given not to ſuffer his Lordſhip to have a Knife, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> This was ſaid, the more eaſily to induce people to believe that my Lord did indeed cut his own Throat: but <hi>Monday</hi> will not now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch Orders were given him. And obſerve how inconſiſtent <hi>Monday</hi>'s Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is! for he pretended that they had Orders not to ſuffer his Lordſhip to have a Penknife or Razor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet at the ſame time confeſſed he left this Razor with his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the Warder hath before depoſed, and now declares, That this Razor he ſaw <hi>Bomeny</hi> deliver to my Lord, whilſt he ſtood Warder at my Lord's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, after <hi>Monday</hi> was gone down ſtairs.</p>
            <p>Let us now compare theſe three mens Relations as to the time of delivery of the Razor; by doing which, it will plainly appear that no Razor at all was delivered to his Lordſhip. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er underſtanding hereof, I ſuppoſe <hi>Bome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> under Examination with the Jury, and anſwering according to what he hath ſworn,</p>

               <p>What time was it, when you ſaw my Lord have the Razor in his hand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Monday.</speaker>
               <p>About Seven of the Clock, as ſoon as the Gentleman-Gaoler had opened my Lord's Chamber-door; for I firſt ſtood Warder above Stairs; and as ſoon as the door was opened, I ſaw my Lord have the Razor in his hand, and obſerved him to pare his Nails with it.</p>

               <p>Was this before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came up to my Lord's Chamber-door, to ſtand Warder there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Yes, almoſt two hours.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>This is according to their own Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Relations. Now, can you believe that this Razor was delivered by <hi>Bomeny</hi> at Eight of the Clock on <hi>Friday</hi> morning, according to his firſt Oath; and yet not delivered till Eight of the Clock on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, according to <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s ſecond Oath? And can you alſo believe that the Razor was not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered till about Nine of the Clock on <hi>Friday</hi> morning, according to <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Information; and at the ſame time give credit to <hi>Monday,</hi> who declared, My Lord had the Razor by Seven of the Clock, two hours before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came up to ſtand Warder at my Lord's Chamber-door?</p>
            <p>Theſe three are of equal Credit, and conſequently you have as much reaſon to believe <hi>Bomeny</hi> as <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves equal Credit with either of the former: But all cannot be credited; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Contradiction be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: Or can One of theſe be thought True, without giving the Lie to the other Two?</p>
            <p>Therefore upon the whole matter, you cannot reaſonably believe there was any Razor at all delivered.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56409:25"/>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, that all Three in the main agree, That my Lord had a Razor delivered him to pair his Naile, and their Contradictions is only in point of Time.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 'Tis true, it's a Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Contradiction in point of Time; and the Contradiction of the Two Elders in the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> was a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Contradiction in point of Place; for the firſt ſwore they took <hi>Suſanna</hi> in Adultery under a <hi>Maſtick-tree,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond under a <hi>Holm-tree:</hi> both theſe agree in the main, <hi>viz.</hi> That they found her in Adultery; but by this Contradiction, as to the <hi>place, where, Daniel</hi> convinced all then preſent, that theſe two Elders were perjured in their Evidence (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Suſanna</hi> innocent of her Charge) and thereupon theſe Two Accuſers juſtly ſuffered, what by Perjury they would have unjuſtly cauſed to be inflicted upon the Innocent. And I never yet heard any deny <hi>Daniel</hi>'s wiſdom in this Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or arraign his Juſtice in the puniſhment thoſe Two Falſe Accuſers thereupon ſuffered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That my Lord's Body was not locked into the Cloſet. I will now ſuppoſe that <hi>Bomeny, Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> were to anſwer as to the opening this Door, according to their former Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and you will find their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, as to this, as groſs as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

               <p>When I had knocked at the Cloſet-door, my Lord not anſwering, I did open the door, and there ſaw my Lord ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-long in his Blood, and the Razor by him, and I then called the Warders.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>This according to his firſt Information, taken (as before) by the Coroner.</p>
            <p>About an hour after this, the Jury did again examine him as to this Point; and he anſwering according to the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which (as before) he writ in the Room next the Jury, and then you will find it as followeth.</p>

               <speaker>Bomeny.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did not, but <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did; for after I had knocked at the Door thrice, calling, My Lord; my Lord not anſwering, I took up the Hangings, and peeping through a Chink, I ſaw Blood, and part of the Razor; whereupon I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Warder <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Ruſſel</hi> puſhed the Door open.</p>

               <speaker>Monday.</speaker>
               <p>I was ſtanding at the foot of the Stairs, and hearing a great noiſe of my Lord's Death, I ran up Stairs, and found <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> endeavouring to open the Door; but the Body being ſo cloſe and ſtrong againſt the Door, neither could.</p>

               <p>I being much ſtronger than either of theſe two, put my Shoulder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Door, and puſhing with all my might, I broke it open.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56409:25"/>
            <p>Upon the whole matter you find, firſt, <hi>Bomeny</hi> opened the Door before he called either of the Warders, according to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi>'s firſt Information taken (as before) by the Coroner; and ſecondly, That he did not open the Door, for <hi>Ruſſel</hi> opened it, according to <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s ſecond Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which himſelf writ) and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Depoſitions: And thirdly, That neither <hi>Bomeny</hi> nor <hi>Ruſſel</hi> could open the Door, becauſe the Body lay ſo cloſe againſt it, and ſo <hi>Monday</hi> broke it open: This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Monday</hi>'s account of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Theſe Contradictions before obſerved of themſelves, are (as I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) ſufficient to convince the man not byas'd, that this Unfortunate Lord was treacherouſly murthered; for our Law ſuppoſes every man deſtroy d by violent means, to be murther'd by others, unleſs the contrary appears to the Coroner, and his Jury; now thoſe which in this caſe come to teſtify the contrary, are ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſelf-deſtructive in their Evidence by their groſs Contradictions, that all theſe three appear treacherouſly falſe, and therefore theſe mens Evidence thus contradictory, cannot prove the Self-murther, but rather demonſtrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for theſe three being the only Men, who by their <hi>Stations near</hi> my Lord at the time of his Death, could then be ſuppoſed capable of giving any account how my Lord came by his death; (for <hi>Bomeny</hi> attended upon my Lord in his Chamber; and <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the two Warders which alternately kept my Lord's Chamber-door, for when <hi>Monday</hi> kept my Lord's Chamber-door, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood at the Stairs-foot-door, and this by turns); and ſeeing theſe mens Relations, for the Reaſons before obſerved, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly falſe, there was <hi>a Truth</hi> which theſe Perfidious Men thought neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient or ſafe to declare, which would have detected the <hi>true</hi> manner of my Lord's Death, and in what parts theſe Three ſtood related thereunto.</p>
            <p>I would fain ask the Coroner, and his Jury, What Inquiſition they would have brought in upon my Lord's Body, in caſe <hi>Bomeny, Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they would not diſcover what they knew with relation to my Lord's Death? I am apt to have ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Opinion of the Diſcretion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of theſe Gentlemen, as to believe they would have been ſo far from finding my Lord <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> that they would have found him murthered by others, and theſe three concern'd therein: for by their reſpective Stations at the time of my Lord's Death, they could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the <hi>true</hi> manner thereof; and by their refuſals to diſcover their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein, they (tacitly) would have confeſſed their guilt, either as Actors in that Cruel Tragedy, or privy and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. Now as ſuch their firſt poſitive refuſal would have rendered them guilty before the Coroner, and his Jury; ſo their falſe and contradictory Account makes ſome of 'em more Criminal, by ſo great an addition to their firſt Offence. For in the firſt, by their ſilence they would have endeavour'd to conceal the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their Guilt therein; So here by their many falſe Relations (which have ſo plainly appear'd, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions cannot be true) have they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to attain the ſame end.</p>
            <p>And for my own part, (admitting what is ſworn againſt them to be true) I think theſe Three are worſe Criminals than thoſe Ruffians who cut my Lord's Throat. For ſome of the latter were not ſo intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with my Lord's Body, as properly to be termed treacherous, neither have they appear'd by falſities to conceal their Guilt by perfidiouſly transferring the ſame on him whom their own Hands have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; But two of the three former <hi>(viz.) Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Bomeny,</hi> if what is ſworn againſt them be true, have ſuperadded the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Treachery and falſity to Blood, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56409:26"/> therefore ſtand guilty of a complicated Villany, by which they have, as much as in them lay, murther'd his Lordſhip's Honour, and ſtain'd his Family with ſuch guilt, as nothing but the diſcovery of Truth, and a juſt recrimination of thoſe Treacherous Men can wipe off.</p>
            <p>But as a farther Argument of the Cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door's not being locked upon my Lord's Body; it appears, That when <hi>Bomeny, Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> pretended my Lord was lying in that poſture wherein they firſt found him, his Lordſhip s Legs were part out of the Cloſet-door, as you ſee in the Figure at the beginning of this Book; this is declared by <hi>Will. Turner</hi> and <hi>Sam. Peck,</hi> who before the Lords have in ſubſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <q>That theſe two Informants were Servants to the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at the time of his death, and brought ſome Proviſions into the <hi>Tower</hi> juſt upon the firſt diſcovery of my Lord's Death, of which as ſoon as they heard, they ran up Stairs, and found my Lord's Legs lying upon the Threſhold of the Cloſet-door, and a print of a bloody Foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Lord's Stockins.</q> This proves not only that the Cloſet-door could not be locked (as was ſworn and declared by <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>) but likewiſe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had been with the Body in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, or otherwiſe how came the print of a bloody Foot upon my Lord's Stockins, as theſe ſwear to have obſerved?</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> and laſt place, I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that part of theſe Mens Relations which ſaith, <hi>That the Razor was locked into my Lord's Cloſet when his Lordſhip was firſt by them ſeen dead.</hi> Thoſe Three have all depoſed, or often declared, <q>That the Razor was found by my Lord's Body locked into the Cloſet; and all Three denied that there was any bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window juſt before my Lord's Death was firſt diſcovered to thoſe out of the Houſe.</q>

               <hi>William Edwards,</hi> aged about Eighteen years, and <hi>Jane Loadman,</hi> aged about Eighteen years, have both before the Lords in ſubſtance depoſed, <q>That a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before my Lord's Death was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, they ſaw a bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window, and that juſt after there came a Maid in a White-hood out of Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe;</q> which Maid, <hi>William Edwards</hi> hath depoſed, <q>took up the Razor, and run with it into Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe, and up Stairs, crying out Murther; and immediately hereupon was it firſt ſaid, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his Throat.</q>

               <hi>William Edwards</hi> did farther depoſe to this effect; <q>That the very morning Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> and I were try'd, going into <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> to be an Evidence at that Trial, he met with Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> who in a threatning manner told him, That if he might have the management of him, the ſaid <hi>William Edwards</hi> ſhould be whipt once a Fortnight for ſeven years together; which Threat of the ſaid Major <hi>Hawley</hi> did ſo terrify this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, (he being then about Thirteen years of Age) that he was afraid to ſpeak the Truth at that Trial, leſt he ſhould ſeverely ſuffer for ſo doing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Smith,</hi> Aunt to <hi>Jane Loadman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glasbrook,</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">

               <q>That this Relation <hi>Jane Loadman</hi> gave as ſoon as ſhe came from the <hi>Tower</hi> that morning.</q>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56409:26"/>Mrs. <hi>Gibbons</hi> hath before the Lords (in ſubſtance) depoſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Here are two Children (aged then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Thirteen years) altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to each other, and whoſe Relations were as much ſtrangers to one another, that gave the ſame Relation, exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in ſeveral Circumſtances, and this Story by them was told when there could not poſſibly be any uſe made of it to prove my Lord's being murthered. For here are Seven or Eight Witneſſes have (for both Parties) depoſed, that this Story was related by theſe two about Ten of the Clock the very day my Lord died, when it could not poſſibly be known what would be ſworn before the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Jury the then next day. Now the only uſe made of it, is to contradict the Depoſitions of thoſe which before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner would have proved the Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which Depoſitions (as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) were not taken till the <hi>Saturday</hi> (which was the day after theſe two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had given this Relation) and not publiſhed before the then next <hi>Monday</hi> morning. Nay, theſe two Children were firſt ſo far from uſing it as an argument of my Lord's being murthered, that both of them (to their reſpective Relations) when checked for ſaying that my Lord cut his own Throat; in their Childiſhneſs and innocent Simplicity, urged this as an Argument of my Lord's Self-murther; <hi>For they declared they were ſure 'twas true, for they ſaw him throw the Razor out of the Window.</hi> But theſe two Children were not the only Perſons that ſaw this Razor thrown out; for ſeveral others that very morning my Lord died, declared, That the bloody Razor was thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window before my Lord's Death was known, and that a little Boy did endeavour to take up this Razor, but was prevented by the Maid, who took it up, and ran with it into the Houſe, and up Stairs, immediately whereupon my Lord's Death was diſcover'd. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>Robert Meake,</hi> before mentioned, did give, the very day of my Lord s Death, to <hi>Bampton</hi> and his Wife (as they have depoſed before the Lords). The ſame Account did the aforeſaid <hi>Ruddle</hi> give before Twelve of the Clock the day my Lord died, to <hi>Hughs</hi> and <hi>Gladwin,</hi> as they have teſtified before the Lords. This Relation of theſe Two you find agrees ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with what <hi>William Edwards</hi> declared. And that the throwing out this bloody Razor was commonly reported in the <hi>Tower</hi> juſt after my Lord's Death was known, appears by the Teſtimony of ſeveral Perſons; for <hi>John Salbury</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <q>That being ſent as one of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Guard to the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> a they were returning to the <hi>Tower</hi> that morning, one met them in great haſte, and declared he juſt then came from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and thrown the Razor out of the Window; upon which one reply'd to this effect,</q> That my Lord had a good Reſolution, firſt, to cut his Throat, and after to throw the Razor out of the Window. He farther teſtifieth, <q>That when he came into the <hi>Tower,</hi> he heard it declared by ſeveral, that the bloody Razor was thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window before his Death was known.</q> 
               <hi>Grimes</hi> and <hi>Boſtick</hi> both, likewiſe in the <hi>Tower</hi> that very morning, have depoſed, <q>That the throwing out of this bloody Razor was talked of by ſeveral then in the <hi>Tower</hi> upon the firſt diſcovery of my Lord's Death, ſome then and there declaring, That they ſaw this bloody Razor ſo thrown out.</q> But if theſe many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies will not ſatisfy, I ſhall next give you the Confeſſion of him who declared he threw it out, and of the Sentinel who ſtood by my Lord's Lodging-door, and confeſſed he ſaw it thrown out.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Story</hi> did farther depoſe, <q>That the very day Major <hi>Webſter</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, to wit, the 21ſt of <hi>January,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56409:27"/> 1688.</q> as ſuſpected to be concern'd in my Lord's Murther; The ſaid <hi>Webſter</hi> being then charged as concern'd in my Lord's Murther, declared, <q>He did nothing but throw the Razor out of my Lord's Chamber-window.</q> Being asked what made him throw the Razor out? he ſaid he was under ſuch a conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he knew not what he did. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Confeſſion of Major <hi>Webſter, Lloyd</hi> confirm'd the ſame, ſaying, <q>That it was indeed true that the bloody Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor was thrown out; for it was thrown out juſt over his head, and a little Boy did endeavour to take it up, but the Maid came out of the Houſe, and took it up, and run immediately in with it, and then diſcover'd my Lord's Death:</q> That this Maid did carry up the Razor, and then diſcover my Lord's Death, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>John Nuthill,</hi> who depoſeth, <q>That juſt before my Lord's Death was known, he was leaning over the Pales before Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe, and asked my Lord's Sentinel how his Lordſhip did? To which the ſaid Sentinel anſwered, Very well: And this Deponent did then obſerve a Maid run into the Houſe in great haſt, and up Stairs (when a Warder and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were coming down my Lord's Stairs, but declared nothing of my Lord's Death, as this Deponent could hear, who ſtood about ſix foot from them) but ſhe immediately came down, and cried, my Lord had cut his Throat. And this Informant did obſerve the ſaid Maid to have a Razor in her hand, either as ſhe ran up ſtairs, or as ſhe came running down.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeveral large Notches in the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, as you may obſerve in the Cut, are Self-evidences of its fall from ſome height upon an hard Body; for theſe Notches could not be made by my Lord againſt his Neck-bone, as a Surgeon fooliſhy or Knaviſhly ſuggeſted to the Coroner's Jury.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all in a word with relation to this Particular. Major <hi>Webſter</hi> (one of the ſuppoſed Ruffians)<note n="a" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Story.</hi>
               </note> confeſſed he threw the bloody Razor out of my Lord's Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. <hi>Lloyd</hi> the Sentinel likewiſe<note n="b" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Story.</hi>
               </note> own'd that he ſaw it thrown out. <hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Loadman</hi> have depoſed, That they did ſee the bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window;<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Tho. Edwards. Sarah Edwards. Eliz.

               </note> Three have ſworn that <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> gave this Relation as ſoon as ſhe returned from the <hi>Tower</hi> that very morning; (and theſe Children, and their Relations, far diſtant from, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers to each other);<note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bampton</hi> and his Wife as to <hi>Meake. Hughs</hi> and <hi>Gladwin</hi> as to <hi>Ruddle.</hi>
               </note> two Soldiers in every part of their Relation, the very day of my Lord's Death, did at two Places, far diſtant from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, declare this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and<note n="f" place="margin">Grimes, Salisbury <hi>and</hi> Boſtock.</note> three more have depoſed, That the throwing out of the Razor was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſcourſt in the <hi>Tower</hi> juſt upon the firſt diſcovery of my Lord's Death. This I do humbly conceive to be ſufficient to convince any but Prejudice it ſelf, that the Razor was ſeen thrown out, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it could not be locked into the Cloſet with the Body, as <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> have depoſed, or often declared. Whereas <hi>Bomeny</hi> ſwore before the Coroner, That peeping through a Chink of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-door, he ſaw the Razor; this appears to be impoſſible, conſidering the Poſition of the Razor, and the Circumſtances of the Chink.</p>
            <p>For the Razor they all declare lay in the upper part of the Cloſet by the Cloſe-ſtool, where the Letter R. ſtands in the Cloſet, according to the Figure; the only Chink of the Door is in that part next the Chimney, where the ſtreak and Letter C
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56409:27"/> ſtands; now looking throw that Chink when the Door is locked, you cannot ſee within three foot of the place where the Razor was ſaid to lie; this was about a year ſince demonſtrated to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> now Governor of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and to ſeveral Gentlemen more.</p>
            <p>The Maid, who is ſuppoſed to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Razor, denies it, and in her defence ſaith to this effect;</p>
            <q>
               <p>That ſhe went out of her Maſter's Houſe almoſt half an hour before my Lord's Death was known, and returned not until my Lord's Death was publick, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral People in the Houſe to ſee my Lord: For ſhe tells this Story, 'That about half an hour before my Lord's Death was diſcover'd, my Lord's Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to her, and told her, the Warder would not open the Wicket to let in my Lord's Proviſions that were brought, and therefore begged her to go to her Maſter (Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Porter) to deſire him to go to the Warder that kept the Gate, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to let in the Proviſions.</p>
               <p>She did accordingly go to her Maſter, who thereupon order'd the Waredr to let in my Lord's Proviſions; and as they <hi>(viz.)</hi> my Lord's Footman, <hi>Will. Turner,</hi> and one <hi>Sam. Peck,</hi> and a Porter, were bringing the Proviſions, a Sentinel told them they were come too late; upon which this Maid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares ſhe was ſurprized, and asked <hi>William Turner</hi> what ſhould be the meaning of that Expreſſion, You are come too late; for ſhe did not underſtand it: whereto <hi>Turner</hi> anſwered, That he did ſuppoſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel believed thoſe Proviſions to be my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, who being gone to his Trial, this Soldier might think he would never return again to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſo the Proviſions were brought too late. This (ſhe declares) ſhe then believed; but as ſoon as they came in ſight of her Maſter's Houſe, they admired to ſee ſo great a Crowd about the Door, but were ſoon too well ſatisfied in the occaſion, for it was juſt before diſcovered that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But this is a forged Lye throughout; for <hi>William Turner, Samuel Peck,</hi> and the Porter, do all three declare, That the Maid was not with them whilſt they were bringing in the Proviſions, neither did the Warder that kept the Gate in the leaſt ſcruple the letting in my Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Proviſions; this they all ſay, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depoſe.</p>
            <p>All men, I find, are to ſeek of the reaſon that ſhould move theſe Men to throw the bloody Razor out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-window before my Lord's Death was diſcovered. But if we conſider the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that might naturally ſeize theſe men upon the leaſt diſturbance in this Deed of Darkneſs, we muſt not expect that what is done under a ſudden Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould be according to the deepeſt Policy. And you find that <hi>Webſter</hi> did confeſs, That when he threw the Razor out, he was under ſuch a confuſion, that he knew not what he did. This Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be occaſioned by ſome ones coming up Stairs, who was not then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the Murther, before they had laid all things aſide, as they deſigned they ſhould be found by ſuch as were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern'd in it; and <hi>Webſter</hi> having the bloody Razor in his hand, which was deſigned to be laid by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the pretended Inſtrument of the feign'd Self-murther; upon the coming up of one, of whom he was not aware, he under a ſurprizing fear of a diſcovery, threw the Razor out of the Window, and the Maid was afterwards ſent for it, and then was it laid by the Body as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſtrument of Death. For this I have ſome reaſon, which I think not fit now to publiſh.</p>
            <p>That Major <hi>Webſter</hi> was one of the Ruffians, and conſequently might be the Man who threw this bloody Razor out of my Lord's Chamber-window (as himſelf confeſſed, farther appears probable by his producing (that day my Lord was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered) the Earl's Pocket-handkerchief all bloody (the Handkerchief was known
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56409:28"/> by the E, and Coronet upon it) and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it, ſaying, there was the blood of a Traytor; and the very next morning a Purſe of Gold of 49 Guineas, and a Piſtol, which, rejoycing, he produced to ſome of his Neighbours, and immediately after my Lord's Death lived at a rate much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Quality (being a poor Alehouſe-keeper, and Under-bailiff of the <hi>Tower</hi> Liberty) and (as I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) in ſome few months after my Lord's Death, loſt at Gaiming ſeveral hundreds of Pounds, which made thoſe that had well known his Poverty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he robbed; but ill got, ill ſpent; for his Extravagancy and Loſſes ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to his former neceſſity; whereupon one upbraiding his Wife (or his Whore as he now calls her, for he ſaith he never married her, and therefore though ſhe is living, he keeps, or hath married another.) I ſay, upbraiding his Wife with her Husband's Poverty, ſhe replied, That her Husband not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had five hundred Guineas; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the other declared he could not come by them honeſtly, for his Trade would ſcarce find him Bread. In Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe-keeping he run very deep in the Brewer's debt; but juſt after my Lord's Murther, he paid his Brewer Thirty Guineas in part, which made the Brewer wonder how he came by ſo much Gold. But not diſcharging the whole Debt, and beginning to contract new, the Brewer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and at laſt in Execution ſeiſed his Goods; whereupon M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jor <hi>Hawley</hi> (for what reaſon is not unſuſpected) was a daily Solicitor to the Brewer for this <hi>Webſter,</hi> and at laſt offered a conſiderable Sum in diſcharge of the Debt.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Webſter</hi> very much abuſing his Wife (or Whore) ſhe told him, <q>That he was a Fool as well as a Rogue, to abuſe her ſo, when he knew it was within her power to hang him, and one in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and naming (as I have been informed) Major <hi>Hawley</hi> for the Man in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </q> A great part of this is depoſed, and the whole ready to be proved. — But farther, to diſprove my Lord's cutting his Throat in the Cloſet:</p>
            <p>Had my Lord cut his Throat ſtanding in the Cloſet, that part of the Wall as high as his Throat would have been all bloody; for the Cloſet being about three Foot and two Inches wide, it could not be otherwiſe; for the Blood out of ſo large an Orifice might have guſhed five Foot. Or, if my Lord had cut his Throat kneeling, the blood in the Wall would then have been as high as his Throat might have been in that poſture. But there was no blood a foot higher than the Floar, therefore he could not cut his Throat either ſtanding or kneeling. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ſuppoſed to be done lying along, for then the Wound beginning at the left ſide, (and his Lordſhip being Right-handed) and ending at the Right, the Razor would have lain on the right, whereas the Razor lay on the left-ſide of the Body. But leſt the Circumſtances of the Body, as firſt pretended to be found, might prove a detection of this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, care was taken that before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner's Jury ſaw the Body, the Body ſhould be ſtript, and the Cloathes carried away, and the Room and Cloſet waſhed, ſo that the Body might appear as naked of its firſt Circumſtances, as it was of its Cloathes. This particular was ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly irregular, or rather criminal in ſome degree, that all men know the Law requires the contrary. For by the firſt Poſture of the Body, with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Cloathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> great light may be given to the true manner of his Death. But that in this Caſe was not to be diſcover'd, and therefore ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices were neceſſary. My Lord's Cloathes were not only carried way, but when demanded by the Jury, as what might be ſerviceable in their Inquiſition, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner was upon this Queſtion immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called into the next Room, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, told the Jury, <hi>It was the Body, and not the Cloathes, they were to ſit upon;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56409:28"/> the Body was there, and that was ſufficient.</hi> It is an unhappineſs the Coroner hath forgot (as he ſwears) who thoſe were which were in the next Room, whilſt the Jury ſat, and to whom, whilſt they ſat, he did ſeveral times go; but had the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeen the Cloathes upon the Body in its firſt Poſture, theſe would of themſelves have convinced them, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was murthered; for how could there be a print of a bloody Foot upon my Lord, and yet none (as they pretended) had been in the Cloſet with him? Or how could his Lordſhip with ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument as the Razor, cut twice through the neck of his Cravat? For <hi>Alice Carter</hi> and <hi>Mary Johnſon,</hi> who (together with Major <hi>Webſter</hi>) ſtript the Body, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as hath been depoſed, the neck of my Lord's Cravat was cut in three pieces. The Circumſtances of the pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Death, gives ſtrong ſuſpicion of the Murther; for the pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Self-murther, was a <hi>French</hi> Razor about four Inches and a quarter in its Blade, and had no Spill or Tongue at the end, as you may perceive by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure thereof in the Cut. Wherefore this Razor in its uſe muſt be held by the very Blade, and not leſs than two Inches of that could well ſuffice to be held in his hand for that ſtrength and ſteadineſs the cutting twice through the Cravat, and afterwards ſo deep in the Neck, required. And then the Wound, if made at once, would not have been above two Inches and a quarter deep, no more of the Blade being outſide the Hand, which length could not at once poſſibly make a Wound above three Inches in depth; I do ſuppoſe none do believe his Lordſhip cut twice to effect it.</p>
            <p>The largeneſs of the Wound at firſt, did make very ingenious Phyſicians and Surgeons ſay, that they ſuppoſed it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to cut his Throat, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the two Surgeons upon my Lord's Body depoſed, the Wound being ſuch, both Jugulars and Arteries quite divided, and cut to the very Vertebres of the Neck: now in cutting the firſt Jugular Artery, there would immediatly have iſſued ſuch a quantity of blood and ſpirits, as would have ſoon incapacitated him from dividing the ſecond; and though as Ingenious an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt as moſt in <hi>England,</hi> before their Lordſhips would not ſay that he thought it impoſſible his Lordſhip ſhould ſo cut his Throat; yet he did confeſs, that he never ſaw or heard of any before, who cut through both Jugulars and Arteries to the Neck-bone, as my Lord's was cut. This Gentleman for ſome years having been Phyſician to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> he may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have as many Inſtances of Self-violences as any Phyſician in <hi>England;</hi> and of all men, none do it with that good-will and vigor as the Deſtracted do, and therefore ſhould make the deepeſt and largeſt Wounds. But I think I need not inſiſt in this Caſe upon ſuch Arguments, conſidering what is before ſaid to be proved. Now to proceed with the Jury.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen, had they not been hurried into their Inquiſition (as you will hereafter find they were) by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as it was left naked, upon a ſtrict view might well have been ſatisfied his Lordſhip fell not a Self-ſacrifice; for it's proved there were five Cuts in his Right hand <hi>(viz.)</hi>

               </note> one almoſt on the top of the Fore-finger, and another upon the ſame near the Hand;<note n="b" place="margin">Turner <hi>and</hi> Peck.</note> one upon the Fourth Finger, and another upon the Little-Finger, and<note n="c" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sherwood</hi> the Surgeon upon the Body.</note> a fifth about two Inches long in the very Palm of the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; can it be ſuppos'd that his Lordſhip made theſe Wounds (and that upon his Right-hand) for trial how ſharp the Razor was, and how well it would perform what he deſigned to execute? Theſe Cuts cannot be ſuppoſed to be made by holding the Razor. No, theſe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to that direful Cut; and the effects of his ſtrugling with thoſe bloody Men,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56409:29"/> when he ſo often cried out, Murther, murther, murther; as he then uſed his Tongue to diſcover, ſo did he likewiſe his Hands to prevent that treacherous Wound he perceived deſigned for his Deſtruction; and in thus ſtriving to put off the Inſtrument of Death, did his Right hand receive theſe ſeveral Wounds. Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> one of the Coroner's Jury hath depoſed to this effect; <q>That he asked <hi>Bomeny,</hi> whether his Lord was not eſteemed a good man, for ſuch he had heard him repreſented? <hi>Bomeny</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, As good a man as lived. Upon which <hi>Fiſher</hi> ſaid, Then it was very ſtrange ſo good a man ſhould be guilty of ſo bad an Action, for nothing could be worſe than Self-murther; whereupon Major <hi>Hawley</hi> told <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Whoever thought that Action unlike his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, did not know my Lord of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> for every one that was but well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Earl, knew it was his Lordſhip's fixed Principle, That any man might cut his own Throat, or otherwiſe deſtroy himſelf, to avoid a diſhonourable and infamous Death, and therefore this was like my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s avowed Principle.</q> 
               <hi>Fiſher</hi> believing this to be true, was the more eaſily inclin'd to believe that his Lordſhip had followed ſuch his own fixed Principles. But when Major <hi>Hawley</hi> was queſtioned for this Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to the Jury, he poſitively deny'd it, and for anſwer ſaith, that he was not nigh the Victualling-houſe in the <hi>Tower</hi> all the time the Jury was there conſidering of their Inquiſition: And as for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he could not ſay it, for he never heard it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, till their Lordſhips charged him with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuggeſted it. I know it is commonly diſcourſed about Town, that ſuch was his Lordſhip's Principles; and this was induſtriouſly ſpread immediately upon my Lord's Death; but obſerve, Major <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> was the man that ſuggeſted this to the Jury, that they might the more eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Self-murther. And the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor's now denial of this Suggeſtion, or that he ever heard it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, when the matter is poſitively ſworn againſt him (I think) naturally argues that this was a falſe, forg'd, and maliciouſly invented Story by that bloody Party that murthered my Lord, and <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> the man by them pitch'd upon as the moſt proper Perſon to corrupt the Jury (the then proper legal Judges of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my Lord's Death) with this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and villanouſly contriv'd Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; ſo that the Jury might the more eaſily be inclin'd to believe my Lord's Self-murther upon Evidence as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent as falſe. And the Major's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning that he was near the Jury at the Victualling-houſe whilſt they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Enquiry, implies his being conſcious that he was there for a very ill purpoſe, and therefore thought it not ſafe to own his being with them; but he was too officiouſly there, not to be remembred; for when ſome of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moved for Adjourning their Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to the giving notice to my Lord's Family; ſo that if any thing could be proved on my Lord's behalf, it might be by them heard: <hi>Hawley</hi> immediately enters a Caveat, and prevents it; for he tells the Jury, That they could not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, but muſt immediately diſpatch their Enquiry; for His Majeſty was then in Council, and had ſent for their Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and would not riſe till it was brought him. This further ſuggeſtion cauſed the Jury to make more haſte than good ſpeed; and ſo, without that time which was convenient, ended their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. But Major <hi>Hawley</hi> denies this likewiſe, and proteſts, He was not nigh the Jury at the place, or did at all thus haſten them. But this is poſitively ſworn againſt him by ſome of the Jury; and many of the Jury declare they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Major with them at the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe. The indiſcretion in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56409:29"/> and his Jury, I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, which was, their ſuffering <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to come together, and hear each other's Examination; and, which was more fooliſh, to permit <hi>Bomeny,</hi> when he began to heſitate in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, (which alone gave reaſonable grounds of ſuſpicion that he was telling a Lye; for Truth would have readily occurr'd; but Lies were firſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, before they could be given in Evidence), to write his own Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not only ſo, but in the Room next the Jury, where his Tutors were ready to inſtruct him: and yet, after all, this forged Depoſition needed further Amendments at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> (as you will immediately hear); for as it was ſworn, it was not thought fit to be expoſed All men muſt agree, That the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my Lord at the time of his Death, render'd them highly to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as privy to my Lord's Death, if not acting in it, in caſe my Lord did not deſtroy himſelf: For, could <hi>Ruſſel</hi> keep my Lord's Chamber-door (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon Oath confeſſes) and be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what violence was offered to his Lordſhip within the Chamber, (the Room not being fourteen Foot ſquare)? Or could <hi>Bomeny</hi> be waiting on his Lord in the very Chamber, and a ſtranger to the true manner of his Death? Wherefore, in common Diſcretion and Juſtice, theſe Two (and <hi>Monday,</hi> the other Warder, who firſt that morning kept the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, with the Centinel that kept the outward Door) ſhould upon the firſt Diſcovery have been ſeized, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and kept apart, and examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſo that neither might have been privy to the others Examination, by which the Truth would have been ſoon detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for had my Lord deſtroyed himſelf, all their Depoſitions would have ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniz'd (though ſeparately and croſly examined) that the Truth would the more plainly have appeared; whereas on the other hand, in caſe his Lordſhip fell by Treachery, then ſuch Proceedings would have immediately diſcovered it to the Jury; for then theſe Warders, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Centinel, not being able to ſoretell what Queſtions the Jury would ask them, conſequently could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly agree upon their Anſwers. And ſhould their Examinations, upon this Management, have materially interfer'd, and thwarted each other, (as it's natural to ſuppoſe they would; for though Truth be ſtill the ſame, yet Lies are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite), theſe Depoſitions would have been ſo far from proving my Lord a Self-Murtherer, as they would have plainly diſcovered the contrary, and theſe men guilty in a moſt perfidious and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous connivance.</p>
            <p>For, admitting that theſe men, upon their croſs and ſeparate Examination, ſhould have anſwered the Jury as it is before repreſented (which is according to their own Oaths, or repeated Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions), can it be ſuppoſed that any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner and Jury could be ſo void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe and Honeſty, as to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did to ſuch, and ſo many Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But, alas! ſuch fair Practices were not to be expected, where ſuch a foul Villany was to be concealed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of ſecuring apart the two Warders, Servant, and Centinel, poor <hi>William Turner</hi> and <hi>Samuel Peck</hi> (whoſe Depoſitions are before mentioned) were to be locked up cloſe, (with <hi>Bomeny</hi> for a colour), as though theſe two Men were more to be ſuſpected than my Lord's two Keepers. And thus in Cuſtody were theſe two innocent Men kept, whilſt the two Warders and Centinel, the more-to-be-ſuſpected Criminals, were permitted to go at large. But this was contrary to His then Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For as ſoon as King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second (then in the <hi>Tower</hi>) had heard of my Lord's Death, he did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56409:30"/> ſend the Lord <hi>Allington,</hi> Sir C —, and <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Eſq; to my Lord's Lodgings, with Orders, That ſuch as were attending upon my Lord at the time of his Death, ſhould be ſecured and examined, and all things to remain till the Coroner's Jury had ſeen the Body. In Obedience to which Command, Sir C— coming into the Lodgings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take ſome Examinations; but was ſoon interrupted by one, who told Sir C—, His Majeſty did command him immediately to go to the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> and give notice to the then Attorney-General of my Lord's Death, and to know what was to he done therein. Sir C— by the ſame Gentleman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired His Majeſty's leave to finiſh thoſe Examinations he was then upon; but the ſame Meſſenger came the ſecond time, with poſitive Orders (as from His then Majeſty) for Sir C—'s immediate going in Obedience to this repeated Command. Sir C— went: But Sir C— remembers not who this Gentleman was, which thus twice came with Orders as from His then Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. It's a great misfortune, Sir C— remembers not; for by the Meſſenger (it's ſtrongly ſuſpected) it would be ſoon found, His then Majeſty's Authority (in this Command) was uſed by him who too often abuſed it.</p>
            <p>This great haſte to the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> (when that Great Patriot, but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was there Trying) and the indirect uſe, by malicious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this pretended Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the taking off him, of whom we were no longer worthy. — This gave to an Honourable perſon then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bench juſt grounds to ſuſpect, that this Noble Earl was murdered without Form of Law, the more eaſily to deſtroy that great Lord under colour of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Coroner's Inquiſition, and the Depoſitions of <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> being carried in all haſte to <hi>White-hall</hi> in order to their immediate publication; they were there peruſed, and it being found that <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had point-blank contradicted each other; (for the firſt, as before obſerv'd, had ſworn the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Razor the day before my Lord's Death) and the ſecond, that it was not deliver'd till the day of his Death. Theſe Contradictions were not thought convenient to be expoſed, leſt they ſhould give juſt ground of ſuſpicion that the whole was forged; and therefore a Reconciler was ordered to amend the one, ſo it might be agreeable to the other, it matter'd not how inconſiſtent or contradictory they were in the Original, for thoſe could be ſeen by none but the Coroner himſelf, in whoſe cuſtody they were; and 'twas to be ſuppoſed, that the Coroner would not then dare to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what Authority had ordered, ſo to be printed; and hereupon was that Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, as was before obſerved, in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi>'s Information, <hi>page</hi> 3. but this done (as ſome years ſince obſerved by an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author upon this occaſion) without the leaſt congruity either to Senſe or Grammar; for nothing can be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, than that the foregoing part of the Information relates wholly to <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi> but at laſt, without any regard to what <hi>Bomeny</hi> had before ſworn, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 13th Inſtant, is foiſted in, contrary to all Rules of Grammar, and common meaſures of Senſe as well as Juſtice, which juſtly eſteems this printed Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation forged. This forged Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is done with the greateſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity and abſurdneſs, as well as falſeneſs imaginable; and I know not whether the folly of the Suborner (for without doubt the Suborner and Reconciler in this caſe are the ſame, or of the ſame ſtamp) or the Perjury of the ſuborned in that falſe Information be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56409:30"/>
            <p>The Soldiers that were in the <hi>Tower</hi> that morning my Lord was murther'd, having made ſuch Diſcoveries as ſatisfied them my Lord was treacherouſly taken off; they uſed too great freedom in their diſcourſe with relation thereunto; and therefore (as <hi>Robert M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake</hi> declared to two who have dipoſed it) <q>An Officer called ſeveral of them together, and under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Threatning enjoin'd them not to ſpeak one word of what they had either ſeen or heard with relation to my Lord's Death. Wherefore the ſaid <hi>Meake</hi> deſired his Friends not to divulge what he had told them; for ſhould it be known, it would prove his rune:</q> but ſome ſhort time after, <hi>Meake</hi> declared (as three have depoſed, <q>That he did believe he ſhould be privately murther'd for what he knew, and had ſaid with relation to my Lord's Murther, and therefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Bampton</hi> or <hi>Davidſon</hi> (as they have both ſworn) to keep him company that very day, for he much fear'd he ſhould that very day be deſtroyed. But both of them (fearing the danger themſelves might be in) refuſing, that very night was the ſaid <hi>Meake</hi> thrown into the <hi>Tower-ditch.</hi>
               </q> As for <hi>Ruddle</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, all the Information I can have of what is become of him, is, That not long after my Lord's Death he was drawn out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and at <hi>Fort St. George</hi> ſhot to death, but for what reaſon I cannot learn. There was one Mr. <hi>Hawley,</hi> a Warder in the <hi>Tower</hi> that very morning my Lord was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, and by what he had obſerved with relation thereunto, he had reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to a Friend, <hi>That it was a piece of Villany throughout.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> being in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> whilſt I was upon my Trial, ſaid, <hi>He wonder'd what made me ſtir in it, when to his knowledge I knew nothing of the matter; upon which one Mr.</hi> B. <hi>ſaid, Mr.</hi> Hawley, <hi>If you know Mr.</hi> Braddon <hi>knows nothing in this, what muſt you know? to which Mr.</hi> Hawley <hi>made no reply.</hi> But this Gentleman's knowledge in the matter coſt him too dear; for about <hi>March</hi> next after my Lord's Death, being miſſing, one of the Warders, ſuſpected to be a Papiſt, ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hawley <hi>had been prating about the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Death, and therefore was forc'd to fly.</hi> But ſix Weeks diſcover'd how he fled, for he was then found in a River by <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſo changed through the barbarity he had met with, that neither his Face or Body could be known by his neareſt Relations; and his Cloathes were all taken off except his Stockins and Shoes, by which he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be the Man; for he wore three Stockins upon one Leg, and two Stockins and a Seer-cloth upon the other, and (as I have been informed) the lining of the Toes of his Shoes cut out. By theſe remarkable Circumſtances his Wife knew him. She had uſed all poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for finding her Husband; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which ſhe offer'd in ſeveral <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zetts</hi> an Hundred pound Reward to any that could diſcover his Body dead or alive, but it was ſix weeks before he was found. Several of the Soldiers in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that morning my Lord was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, I have been enquiring after, but have been told they were kill'd in the <hi>Weſt</hi> againſt the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But conſidering what fate befel <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Ruddle</hi> and <hi>Meake,</hi> before mentioned, I have reaſon to ſuſpect that other may likewiſe have been murthered by way of prevention</p>
            <p>Beſides ſuch addition of blood, other violent Methods were uſed to prevent a diſcovery, by puniſhing ſuch Soldiers as ſeemed to disbelieve (upon very good grounds) my Lord's Self-murtner. This appears by this Information following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Jorden</hi> declareth, <q>That (ſome time that Summer the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died, and not long after the ſaid Earl's Death) he ſaw a Solder tied to the Wooden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe in the <hi>Tower</hi> (by order of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <hi>(viz.) Some ſhort time after the Death of the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Norwich.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine coming into the</hi> Tower, <hi>the ſaid Soldier was ſent with him to ſhew him the</hi> Tower, <hi>and as the Doctor was almoſt over-againſt Major</hi> Hawley<hi>'s, the Doctor asked the ſaid Solder, which was the Chamber wherein the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>did cut his Throat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid Solder (pointing to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in which the Earl had been Priſoner) ſaid, that is the Chamber in which</hi> it is ſaid <hi>the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>cut his Throat. The Doctor then asked the Soldier, what he did believe? to which the Soldier anſwered, That he did believe in God; but being preſt by the ſaid Doctor to tell him, whether he did believe my Lord cut his Throat? The Soldier then replied, be would not ſay he did believe it; for which only ſaying, the Puniſhment aforeſaid was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the more effectually to prevent any diſcourſe that might give the leaſt credit to my Lord's being murthered, our then Miſgovernment took all poſſible care to puniſh, or rather oppreſs ſuch as ſhould declare their belief thereof; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which one of the Coroner's Jury upon the Earl's Body, ſuffer'd under this Tyranny; for this man, ſome time after my Lord's Death, diſcourſing concerning the Earl's Death, and the ſeveral Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities which he obſerved practiſed upon my Lord's Body before they ſaw it, and how they were not permitted to make that Inquiry which was neceſſary; ſaid to this effect; <q>That he did believe they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Coroner's Jury) were all infatuated to bring my Lord in <hi>Felo de ſe;</hi> but he did ſuppoſe, had they not been hurried into their Inquiſition, they ſhould have found it otherwiſe.</q> For this Diſcourſe this honeſt poor man was proſecuted upon information, and fin'd (at firſt I have heard) 300 <hi>l.</hi> but it appearing he was very poor, his Poverty prevail'd for a mitigation of his Fine; and his Age and great Infirmities of Body (together with the charitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of a Gentleman of Intereſt in the then times) avoided the corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which he had otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.</p>
            <p>If ſuch practices as theſe were us'd by our then Court to prevent my Lord's but being ſuſpected to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the'd, it could not be ſuppos'd that any encouragement ſhould be given to a full detection, and therefore all propoſals in order thereunto, were to be rejected; an Inſtance whereof was as followeth, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About ſix weeks after my Lord's Death, there was a Letter (unſealed) left with one Mr. <hi>Cadman,</hi> then living in <hi>Durham</hi> Exchange; the Letter was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Right Honourable the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs Dowager of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> the ſubſtance of this Leter was, <hi>That if her Honour could prevail with the King for the Author's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he would ingenuouſly make a full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, how, by whom, and whoſe Order my Lord was Murthered: and this Letter did aſſure her Honour, that the</hi> DUKE <hi>of</hi> YORK <hi>and — were authorizing this Murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter was ſubſcribed <hi>P. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Hand that writ it, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubſcribed, it was <hi>Paul Bomeny</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, (who did once blaſphemouſly ſay, <hi>That he could as well tell how my Lord
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56409:31"/> came by his Death, as God Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>) for the Letter was fairly writ, in a hand between a <hi>Roman</hi> and an <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſuch an Hand <hi>Bomeny,</hi> when he would write fair, did write; beſides, the two letters ſubſcribed, are the letters of his Name.</p>
            <p>I do ſuppoſe it may be objected, That this Letter cannot be thought to be writ and ſubſcribed by <hi>Bomeny</hi>); for the Letter, had it been brought in accuſation againſt him, and prov'd to be his, would have coſt him his life, ſeeing herein he confeſs'd himſelf guilty of the Fact.</p>
            <p>But, with ſubmiſſion, I think <hi>Bomeny</hi> by this Letter, could it have been proved to be his own writing, was in no danger at all of being puniſhed; for had they ſeized <hi>Bomeny,</hi> they would have catched a <hi>Tarter;</hi> ſhould they have proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for this Murther, upon this Confeſſion, the World would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the whole Contents of this Letter to be true; and conſequently that the <hi>Duke of</hi> York, and — authorized (or rather commanded) this moſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Murther. And then pray conſider what that Government could have got by ſuch proſecution, conviction and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This Letter was carried by <hi>Cadman</hi> to a Juſtice of Peace, and by him to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State: but this Bookſeller was never ſent for, nor any enquiry made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Author.</p>
            <p>The backwardneſs of the then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in not examining into the matter, gave juſt grounds of ſuſpicion they were too well ſatisfied in the Truth of the Contents; which was of ſuch a nature, as it could not bear an Inquiſition; for that would have centred in <hi>His Ruine,</hi> who was then by Blood, and Cruelty, and other illegal and oppreſſive Methods, endeavouring the total Subverſion of our Church and State; and this by the removal of ſome of the Chief of thoſe Noble Lords and Worthy Gentlemen, who had ever oppoſed their Arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Amongſt which, this Noble Lord and the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> they did eſteem two of the Chief.</p>
            <p>Had none then in Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been concerned in this barbarous Treachery, and had our then Government had the leaſt deſire to know this Truth, in order to a juſt Puniſhment of thoſe bloody Villains; with what diligence would they bave ſearch'd out the Author, who deſired no other Reward than the Security of his Life; and in order to his Indemnity (if they could no otherwiſe have found him out) a Proclamation of Pardon would immediately have been iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, by which the Author would have been aſſured of his Life; and then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, according to his promiſe, would have laid open this bloody deed of darkneſs? Hath our Age ever ſeen, or known recorded, any Murther (admit this one) committed within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that hath been (all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered) attended with ſuch aggravations? We have ſeen a Reward of 200 <hi>l.</hi> (as well as a Pardon) by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation offered for the diſcovery of thoſe bloody Ruffians, who barbarouſly wounded (but <hi>deſign'd</hi> to have murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that Worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> And was there not 500 <hi>l.</hi> and a Pardon by Proclamation promiſed to Him or Them that ſhould detect the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey?</hi> Such means as theſe would have been likewiſe in this Caſe uſed, if ſuch who then miſled <hi>Charles</hi> 2. and corrupted the State, had not been the deepeſt in this black Contrivance.—</p>
            <p>This <hi>Bomeny,</hi> ſoon after my Lord's Death, gives an eminent Divine an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to this effect, <hi>(viz.) That his Lord did uſe to be taken with ſudden frenzical Paſſions; and in particular, with one that morning he died, juſt before his Death: For</hi> (ſaid this vile <hi>Judas) as ſoon as my Lord ſaw my Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>go to his Trial, he ſtruck his Breaſt, and ſaid, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Did you obſerve your Lord melancholy, Mr.</hi> Bomeny? <hi>Bomeny</hi> anſwered, <hi>Yes; but we took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; for he us'd to be ſo, and we had no reaſon to ſuſpect any thing more than ordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had this Varlet reſted in the general Affirmative, without proceeding farther, his Anſwer would (it's probable) have better ſerved the deſign of the Queſtion: but by the latter-part of his Anſwer, he deſtroy'd that Service which the firſt word <hi>[Yes]</hi> might have otherwiſe done. And obſerve what a point-blank Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Evidence at the Trial is to what he depoſed (before the Coroner) the very next day after my Lord's Death, when (had this been true) it would have been freſh in his memory, and he would (without doubt) have ſworn it. But this was according to ſome after-inſtruction, not thought of at the time of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Inqueſt.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Holland</hi> was impriſoned for Mr. <hi>Gatford</hi>'s Robbery in <hi>Newgate,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> ſent often thither, and took a more than ordinary care of him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Major <hi>Richardſon</hi> told my Lord's Gentleman, That he did much wonder his Lordſhip would be ſo kind to ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate a Fellow. To which it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That his Lordſhip had a very great kindneſs for <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe he had been Servant to my Lord <hi>Spencer</hi> (my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Son); but it ſeems ſomewhat elſe was in the matter; for it's depoſed by <hi>John Waytis,</hi> 
               <q>That obſerving <hi>Holland</hi> to be frequently furniſhed with Money by my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and —, this Informant asked <hi>Holland</hi> how his Lordſhip became ſo kind to him? To which <hi>Holland</hi> replied (with his uſual phraſe) <hi>Damn him, he had done that for him, that HE DURST NOT DO OTHERWISE.</hi> And when this Informant was once ſaying, It was whiſper'd that the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was murdered; <hi>Holland</hi> ſaid, <hi>Damn him, it was not a farthing matter if twenty ſuch were taken off.</hi>
               </q> He that ſo little
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56409:33"/> valued the lives of Twenty, would not in all probability much boggle to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the murdering One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> writ a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> wherein he repreſented me as endeavouring to ſuborn him to appear an Evidence in the Caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> which Letter was read in the Houſe of Lords. But that which <hi>Holland</hi> falſly called <hi>endeavours to ſuborn,</hi> I ſhall truly and faithfully (as it can be prov'd) declare, and appeal to every impartial Reader, Whether it deſerves that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Name?</p>
            <p>Having ſome reaſon to believe <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> one of the Ruffians, I did uſe all means poſſible for his Apprehenſion; but I found that <hi>Holland</hi> lay very private, and, as I had reaſon to believe, deſigned to fly beyond Seas, (as his own Letter before mentioned declared). Hereupon I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my ſelf to ſome of <hi>Holland</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and by them being brought to Mrs. <hi>Holland,</hi> I told her, That I had reaſon to believe her Husband was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this villanous Murther, and herein I was confirmed by Mr. <hi>Holland</hi>'s abſconding; for Innocence deſires a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but Guilt ſtill flies from Juſtice. I then told her, That if her Husband were really guilty of this Fact, and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrender himſelf, ingenuouſly declaring, <hi>how, by whom, with whom,</hi> and <hi>for what hir'd</hi> to do this barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Husband ſhould have a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon, and both Him and Her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for: But if her Husband was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, (notwithſtanding whatſoever was ſaid to the contrary), and ſhould take upon him a Crime (for any advantage whatſoever) of which he was not guilty, he deſerv'd to be Hang'd here, and Damn'd hereafter, ſeeing by his Perjury he would make Juſtice an Inſtrument of executing the worſt of Murthers.— But if he were indeed the Man, and ſhould ſurrender himſelf, and diſcover the whole matter, he muſt be ſure to keep within the limits of Truth; for ſhould he be detected in the leaſt Perjury, no man was ever more vigorouſly proſecuted, nor any more ſeverely puniſhed, than he (for ſuch his Perjury) muſt expect to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Arguments with which I would have <hi>ſuborn'd</hi> (as that Letter calls it) <hi>Holland</hi> to a full Diſcovery: And I do appeal to all the World, Whether, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this to be true, (as it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when occaſion ſerves) I deſerve this villanous Charge? For the truth of this, I do appeal to the Conſciences of Mrs. <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> with whom I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times treated in this Affair.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now mention one or two more Objections againſt my Lord's being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and then draw to a Concluſion. The firſt is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Right Honourable the Lady Counteſs-Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> having heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (whether lately, I cannot ſay) That ſhe did believe her Lord cut his own Throat; and being ſo poſſeſſed, ſome time after this Committee had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times ſate, ſhe deſired ſeveral Lords (amongſt which ſome were of this Right Honourable Committee) to meet at her Houſe; and after her Honour had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their Lordſhips with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her requeſt, an eminent Divine (and now Biſhop) did inform their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips what were the Reaſons that moved her Honour to believe that her Lord did indeed lay violent hands on himſelf; <hi>the Chief,</hi> if not the <hi>Only</hi> whereof, was, <hi>That ſome ſhort time before my Lord's Commitment to the</hi> Tower, <hi>his Lordſhip ſeemed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great concern of mind; but then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That the trouble he was in did not ariſe from any thoughts of Self-preſervation, for Himſelf was the leaſt of his Care; but the thoughts of his Family, what would after his Death become of them, was what did indeed trouble him: As for himſelf, he was reſolved what to do; SEVERAL TIMES VERY RESOLUTELY REPEAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56409:33"/> THAT EXPRESSION,</hi> AS FOR MY SELF, I AM RESOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED WHAT TO DO. This I was told by a Gentleman then preſent, who (as I have great reaſon to believe) would have repreſented every thing to the beſt advantage (as far as Truth would permit) on the behalf of ſuch Objections. But, with all ſubmiſſion to ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are ſway'd with this Objection, I think it carries not that force which many imagine: For is there <hi>nothing</hi> to which that Reſolution of his Lordſhip might ſo probably have relation, as a <hi>Self-deſtruction?</hi> was that the <hi>only,</hi> or the <hi>moſt likely</hi> thing he was reſolved to do? I do humbly conceive, a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration may afford us both a more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Opinion of his Lordſhip's Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſomewhat <hi>more probable</hi> than Self-murther to be aſſigned as what his Lordſhip <hi>was reſolved to do.</hi> For when I conſider the time when his Lordſhip was apprehenſive of the like danger as threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him juſt before his laſt Impriſonment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> when my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard, &amp;c.</hi> were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and a Gentleman who had a very great Honour for his Lordſhip, (as all good men had, who had the honour to know him) in true Zeal for his Lordſhip's preſervation, (having heard that the Court deſigned likewiſe to commit my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and to take off many in Form of Law; or rather, that which they falſly called ſo) went to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and informed him of what he had been told, and humbly ſubmitted it to his Lordſhip's Judgment, Whether it were not proper for ſome time to withdraw, till the fury of the Court by time was a little appeaſed? This Gentleman told his Lordſhip, He found by the Papiſts, that they did deſign to take off ſeveral; and his Lordſhip being to their Arbitrary and Popiſh Deſigns as great and profeſs'd an Enemy as any, he did fear his Lordſhip might not be ſafe from their pretended Juſtice, when once within their Power My Lord hereupon ſmiled, and ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſedately, and yet very reſolutely, <hi>That he would not ſtir, though he did expect the Court would proceed very far, not only to the Impriſoning, but against the Lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and if God in his Providence ſhould think fit to ſuffer him to fall a Sacrifice to the Malice and Rage of the Court, he did hope, and did not doubt, but the World ſhould ſee that he could die with as GREAT RESOLUTION as ever his Father did; for he was ready at all times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, to lay down his Life for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Reflecting therefore on my Lord's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Reſolution of his not ſtirring, though then under the like danger, as in this caſe apprehended, and with what <hi>readineſs, courage, and chearfulneſs he could lay down his Life for his Country; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the knowledge that he may be ſuppoſed to have of the then Court-Deſigns (which thoſe Villains, nine days before his Death declared; for it is</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Vide <hi>D. Smith</hi>'s <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> firſt mentioned.</note> 
               <hi>ſworn the Papiſts then ſaid, The Earl knew ſo much of their Deſigns, and was ſo very averſe to their Intereſt, that they could never carry them on, UNLESS HIS LORDSHIP WAS TAKEN OFF; AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS THEREFORE TO BE MUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERED.)</hi> I ſay, when I conſider theſe things, and that the more this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord knew of the black Intrigues of the Court, the more ſo good a Man, and ſo true a Patriot muſt be ſuppoſed to hate them; I can't but imagine that this brave State-Champion, when he had been once ſatisfied, that the Court, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Law, would have taken him off, had RESOLVED AS TO HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF, to lay open thoſe Popiſh Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Court-Contrivances, and juſtified that juſt Deſign of ſtanding upon their Guard; there was no other way (under God) to defend what was ſo groſly inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56409:34"/> Now, though his Lordſhip might ſuppoſe, by dealing thus plainly, he ſhould the more exaſperate the Court; ſo that their Malice would be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterately bent in his Deſtruction; <hi>yet that he declared he FEARED NOT, but was ready chearfully to lay down his life in ſo juſt a cauſe.</hi> And ſhould this daring true Lover of his Countrey have thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, by his State-Martyrdom, he would have given ſuch ſatisfaction in the Truth of what he thus couragiouſly, with his laſt breath, ſhould have affirmed, as would have raiſed a general hatred againſt thoſe Arbitrary and Popiſh Court-reſolutions; and this might ſo ſuddenly have given another ſo general a Reſurrection to that juſt Cauſe, as would have totally routed thoſe true and only Enemies of both Church and State. Our then Enemies, under colour of Law, were induſtriouſly endeavouring the total Subverſion of our Laws; and whilſt in <hi>ſhew</hi> they ſeemed to maintain the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> they were ſecretly contriving its <hi>total Deſtruction,</hi> by wreſting thoſe very Laws which were chiefly deſigned as <hi>deſtructive</hi> to Popery, and making them <hi>productive of what they were enacted to deſtroy:</hi> For by a malicious and furious Proſecution of all Proteſtant Diſſenters, they did hope to raiſe ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Animoſities between the Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Non-Conforming Proteſtants, that they might, through ſuch diviſion, have an opportunity to fulfil that notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jeſuitical Maxim, <hi>Divide &amp; Impera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had the leaſt reaſon to deſpair of the late King's Mercy; for ſhould his Lordſhip have been convicted through Falſe Evidence, or Corrupt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Court, by their adjudging that to be Treaſon which the Law never made, or deſigned to make ſo, (as they did in the Caſe of the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and ſome others.) No Nobleman in <hi>England</hi> had better grounds than his Lordſhip to preſume upon the late King's Mercy, ſeeing his Lordſhip's Father had ſacrific'd his life in that King's Service; wherefore his then Majeſty had good reaſon to declare (when His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not many hours before the Earl's Death, ſaid, <hi>the Earl ought to be taken off) that he was reſoved to ſpare his Lordſhip for what his Father had ſuffered;</hi> (this you find before by<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hughs</hi> and <hi>Gladwin.</hi> 29.</note> two ſworn to be declar'd by <hi>Ruddle,</hi> who heard it that very morning my Lord was murther'd); And this account of <hi>Ruddle</hi> ſeems the more probable by what his then Majeſty is generally ſaid to have declar'd ſoon after he heard of that deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Accident, <hi>(viz.) That he did much wonder his Lordſhip ſhould murther himſelf, and not truſt to his Mercy, ſeeing he ow'd him a Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering therefore that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had ſo good cauſe for hopes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under the greateſt danger [even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction] there is the leſs reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>THAT HIS LORDSHIP HAD RESOLV'D TO DESTROY HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF.</hi>— I find this Objection from the Right Honourable the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> hath been generally us'd as what ſhould convince every man that the late Earl did indeed cut his own Throat.— But I would fain ask thoſe Gentlemen (who immediately run away with this as what is ſufficient to anſwer whatſoever ſeems to prove the contrary) <hi>Whether it is within the power of belief or disbelief of a fact, either to alter the nature, or deſtroy the exiſtence of a Fact.</hi> Moſt certainly none will be ſo ignorant as to aſſert, That any thing becomes true by being believ'd, or falſe by being diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, for then according to different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions a thing would be, and not be at the ſame time, which is impoſſible.
